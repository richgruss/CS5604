Why I Did Not Vote

Share this shit...Why I did not vote!
I can proudly say that I did not vote in the 2014 elections being held today. And your criticism of me, for that fact, does not move me in the slightest.
I’ve been listening to one ridiculous candidates bullshit commercials after another for what seems like a lifetime now. All I have learned from those commercials is that one fuckin’ guy in the state of Washington made a zombie movie and I never could tell what the fuck that had to do with the election.
Therein lies the reason why I am boycotting voting in any of this countries elections at this time. I will not vote for someone who doesn’t tell me what they will do, but instead tells me what their opponent has done, will do and/or will not do.
When exactly did the United States of America take a hard turn down this bullshit political road we are on now?
There will be no hope of our political climate changing for the better until two things happen. Those two things are term limits across the board and (serious) campaign finance reform.
We need to 86 every career politician, in every elected position, in every local, county, state and federal governing body. We have to say “no more” to people like John Dingell, John Conyers and Charles Rangel. These three guys have a combined 150 goddamned years in their current office. WTF?
In case you are interested, here is a table from Wikipedia showing current members of the House and Senate who have been in office for the longest time.

58 years,326 days


John Conyers (H)

43 years,305 days


Thad Cochran (H,S)

41 years,305 days


Don Young (H)

Patrick Leahy (S)

Chuck Grassley(H,S)

39 years,305 days


Tom Harkin (H,S)

George Miller (H)

If this doesn’t disgust you as an American citizen, then you are a great deal of the problem. And until we, as a country, can understand, admit and do something about this problem, I can’t be a part of it.
Until I see a candidate who tells me what he or she stands for, instead of telling me what their opponent did, said, didn’t do or didn’t say, I won’t have a part in putting any of them into office.
As always, let me know your thoughts. I will publish all comments and look forward to an open discussion and don’t even mind if you call me names. After all…. I’m the Honey Badger and I don’t give a shit!
