Nigeria's presideNt has formally declared that he will seek a second term of office at next year's general election, just a day after a suicide bomber killed nearly 50 people in the country's northeast.
Goodluck Jonathan has been head of state of Africa's most populous nation, leading economy and top oil producer since 2010, when he took over following the death of President Umara Yar'Adua, winning elections in 2011.
"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, have accepted to present myself on the platform of the PDP," Jonathan told supporters of his Peoples Democratic Party at a mass rally in the capital Abuja on Tuesday.
His supporters took out four-page newspaper advertisements on Monday, calling for Nigerians to "be a witness to history" and saying Jonathan's candida- cy was "in response to Nigerians' demand".
