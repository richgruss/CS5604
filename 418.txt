	BJP has stepped up its Delhi Assembly Election campaign with the party's top brass taking to the streets.
	Leading from the front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is addressing an election rally in North Delhi's Vishwas Nagar.
	 Here are the highlights from his speech:
		PM Modi arrives to address an election rally in New Delhi's Vishwas Nagar.
		PM introduces all the BJP candidate for the February 7 polls.
		You are the voters of Delhi. This election is not limited to who'll be an MLA and who won't; who'll be the chief minister and who won't.
		These elections are about what India's image will be like in the world.
		There is no place better than Delhi which serves as India's identity in the world.
		I have now come to stay in Delhi because you have called me here. If the people of Delhi hadn't given me 7 MPs, would it have been possible for me to come to Delhi.
		But I'm not here to occupy the PM's chair. I'm here to serve you.
		It is not enough that I get space to sit in the South Block. I want an opportunity to serve every neighbourhood of Delhi.
		The world's view of India depends on how we present Delhi.
		The people you voted to power a year ago back stabbed Delhi, betrayed Delhi
		No one can fool the people repeatedly and be successful.
		Delhi needs a stable government, needs people who have experience in running a government.
		Last time we fought under leadership of Dr Harshvardhan and people reposed their faith in BJP.
		People of Delhi made the BJP is the single largest party in the last elections.
		We respected the mandate and refused to get into the politics and deals (saudebaazi) of forming the government.
		The people of Delhi were regretting not giving us the mandate to form the government - but they showed their intentions and gave us all the 7 seats in the Lok Sbaha polls.
		Kiran Bedi has been part of Delhi's history.
		She knows every bylane of Delhi and will take Delhi to new heights.
		BJP refused to buy MLAs after the last Delhi polls.
		Those you voted for ran away from their responsibility.PM Modi talks about Jan Dhan Yojana- government's pro-poor policies:
		Both Delhi and Haryana were ruled by Congress, but still the people of Delhi were bothered about problems of drinking water.
		When BJP came to power in Haryana, the chief minister there took effective steps to give water to Delhi.
		BJP is dedicated to serving the poor. We have decided where there are slums we will make apartment blocks.
		By the time we celebrate the 75th year of independent India, we will ensure that all slums are replaced by cemented houses.
		We have to change the lives of the people of Delhi, give more facilities.
		We have to change the lives of the people of Delhi, give more facilities.
		I need your blessings to make these changes.
		India has emerged as a strong country for the world to contend with.
		Some people were raising a controversy over Obama's visit. I want to ask my critics - if
		Obama had come and there was nothing else than the Jan 26 programme then would have opponents spared us?
		India is a youthful country. A country with such percentage of young blood, has the capability to change the fate of the world.
		The world is looking towards India. The reason isn't Modi but you - the people of India. You have voted for a government with full majority after 30 years.
		When a world leader looks at Modi, he sees 125 crore Indians.
		Some people have committed the sin of wasting a year in Delhi.
		Delhi needs a stable government with full majority - a BJP government under Kiran Bedi's leadership.
