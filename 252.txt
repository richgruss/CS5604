A Labour government will repeal the Lobbying Act, improve working conditions for voluntary sector professionals and encourage young people to volunteer, the shadow minister for civil society said today.
Lisa Nandy who was speaking at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) to representatives of charities and the voluntary sector from across the country, outlined Labour’s vision. Here is what you need to know.
Lobbying
“No relationship between charities and government will ever be comfortable. Nor should it be. 
“But our promise is that we will be just as robust in defending your right to speak because so often you speak for people who don’t have a voice elsewhere,” said the minister.
The Lobbying Act would be replaced with a register of all lobbyists and in the new year Labour will bring forward proposals that make sure charity reporting requirements are clear and not onerous.
“This is just one part of our commitment to revive the Compact at the national level,” said Nandy. “The Lobbying Act is simply not compatible with it. Nor are gagging clauses in public contracts and we will get rid of them – they are bad for us and bad for you.”
In government, Labour propose to fully restore judicial review to a place where charities are able to hold the powerful to account. 
“Only last week a charity helped to win a judicial review with profound consequences for prisoners’ rehabilitation, by overturning the book ban in prisons,” said Nandy, “These are the sorts of poor decisions judicial review ought to challenge.”
If elected Labour propose to overturn the changes the coalition government has brought in, which Nandy says expose charities and others to huge financial risk.
Working in the charity sector
Nandy cited statistics showing that the sector lacked job security, a living wage and came with much stress. According to Unite, 58% of charity workers thought their job was insecure and 81% said pay wasn’t in line with the cost of living. Members from another union, Unison, spoke about stress – 55% working more than their contracted hours, 74% stressed because of work, 9% on zero hour contracts and a quarter with more than one job. 
“We expect the sector to live by its values, and be good employers,” said Nandy. “But, we also know the government has a responsibility for this too.”
Labour proposes to raise the minimum wage and bring in the living wage as part of contract arrangements with companies when commissioning in government. They will also allow government departments to reserve specific contracts for social enterprises and not-for-profits – avoiding a situation where charities and social enterprises are in a bidding war with private companies and huge reserves.
Leon Ward, a trustee at charities Plan UK and Brook welcomes this idea but worries there isn’t enough support in the sector: “There has to be some focus on building capacity in the sector to bid for and successfully implement these contracts.
“Also, to improve pay for those staff fulfilling these contracts you have to increase how much charities can reclaim as costs. That’s an interesting challenge in a time of austerity.”
From 2016-17, all charity workers will be covered by a pension auto-enrolment system but many people will work for organisations whose pension contribution is no more than 3% of their salary.
To help understand the extent of the problem and the work needed, Labour will commission a study of pension provision across the sector. “This will help inform the work needed to ensure that choosing a career in the voluntary sector doesn’t mean choosing a retirement in poverty too,” said Nandy. 
As well as working with the sector to open up entry level opportunities and workforce development, Labour plan to, with NCVO, develop standard guidance on work experience, training and volunteering placements. “This sector attracts great talent. But that should never be off the back of hardship, exploitation or unfair advantage,” she said. 
Volunteering
Labour want more people to have the chance to volunteer. If elected they will continue to support the national campaign Step Up to Serve and introduce a broader curriculum that gives young people opportunities to volunteer from a early age. 
Although Labour want more people to volunteer, Nandy says it makes no sense if it is divorced from what’s happening in society. “Our job as government won’t be to tell people to get involved or how to get involved. Our job will be to break down the barriers that stop them doing it,” she said. 
Labour therefore propose to clamp down on exploitative zero hours contracts, extend free childcare, give people longer term security in their home and raise minimum wage. 
To encourage businesses and their employees to volunteer, Labour will also introduce a kitemark for organistions who give their employees the right to request time off to volunteer. And, to collaborate across sectors and share knowledge and skills, Labour will encourage secondments between the civil service and voluntary sector in government. 
“It couldn’t be clearer,” says Nandy. “We need to learn the lessons of the past and look forward and understand the value of our shared institutions, building societies, charities, social enterprises, community groups.
“They help define us just as we help to shape and define them.”
