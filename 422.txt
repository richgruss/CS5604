Premier Campbell Newman has admitted the LNP could be relegated to just a one-term government in Queensland.Speaking to Fairfax Radio 4BC Mornings, Mr Newman said the 2015 election would be a "tight" contest. And despite having won a historic majority at the 2012 poll, Mr Newman said there was a possibility the Opposition could pull off what was considered an absolute impossibility just two-and-a-half years ago and take back government."...The Labor party could win with the support of independents and minor parties and if that was to happen, that would spell chaos for Queensland," he said."We would see the same situation frankly that we have seen in Canberra for the last seven or eight years. We don't want that. These are uncertain times. We need a strong team to take the state forward."Mr Newman continued his trend of using the word "strong" as an adjective in as many situations as possible, while explaining why he believed the latest published polls showed he still hadn't turned voter support around."Why are people responding in that particular way? Well we have had to make difficult decisions, strong decisions, but we are getting the state back on track, because we have done these things, and I believe in the campaign there is an opportunity for people to do the compare and contrast," he said."Because the other side don't have a plan and they are bringing back the old gang, the people who got us into the mess."Mr Newman said his government had spent the time since the March 2012 election doing "exactly what we were elected to do"."Which was to sort out the big mess economically and financially for the state and also get to work revitalising the economy and turning government around," he said."We have done a lot of those things and there is more to do."
