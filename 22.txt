The Supreme Court & Judicial Tyranny 

 

As Barack Obama continues to fumble foreign policy, while driving America further into an economic ditch—the radical left is poised to takeover an increasingly vulnerable Supreme Court.
Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are both 76 years old. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 79. Stephen Breyer is 74. Of these Justices, Scalia is the only solid conservative.  And if this President is allowed to alter the current makeup of the High Court, we will become a nation unrecognizable to the one founded.
The 2008 election was a disaster for both the Constitution, and the self-reliant individual that the Founders envisioned.  The mid-term ‘tidal wave’ of 2010 was in response to the lawlessness, and imperial nature of the Obama administration. It was the largest change in political power since World War II.
Unfortunately, Obama appointed two committed leftists to the Supreme Court while Democrats had a Super Majority in Congress, and has done equal damage to the lower courts.
D.C. v Heller, the key provision of Citizens United v FEC and Kelo v City of New London were all recent 5-4 decisions. Each case regarded the basic,and universal freedoms enjoyed by all Americans. In Heller (2nd Amendment), and Citizens United (1st Amendment), Justice Kennedy concurred with the conservative majority, even authoring the opinion and upholding the Founding Document (and the will of the people).
In Kelo (5thAmendment), the Constitution and citizenry were not so lucky. Kennedy sided with the liberal majority who took away the basic freedom of private property rights in the specific case and can be used as precedent in future disputes that will inevitably arise. (Obamacare will be handled in a subsequent article unto its own)
We all wait with bated breath each time a landmark case is presented to the Court for a decision that to conservatives, seems like common sense. Yet, we are sometimes disappointed by a result that is often inexplicable. Reading the ruling often makes it more inexplicable, and infuriating. Now imagine a Supreme Court made up of 6-7 far left ideologues. Carefully watching a case progress through District and Appellate courts, tumbling towards the inevitable un-Constitutional fate of a Court stacked with leftists appointed by a President the likes of Barack Obama.
For our Libertarian friends, who insist on voting for Gary Johnson, please reconsider.
One only need to consider American history to know America’s future. So, when deciding whether to  grant Democrats free-reign over the judicial branch and promote its unchecked, unbalanced power—remember that the Democrats also supported the Dred Scott decision, thus allowing the Supreme Court to promote the expansion of slavery.
If for no other reason than the radical threat to the future of the Supreme Court, consider the threat to The Constitution and our Republic.  During the primary, Mitt Romney was not many of our first choice, nor even a second choice.  However, he will be the only one to defeat the current occupant of the White House.  Not Gary Johnson. The time for primary battles and comparing records has come to an end.
Neither the United States, nor its Constitution can afford a repeat of the 1992 election, wherein Ross Perot handed the White House to Bill Clinton. The Clinton administration went-on to promote “Hillary-Care” and actually mandated sub-prime loans—which all but nationalized the real estate and financial industries.
Patriots shudder to think of what an Obama second term will look like. America will become utterly divided, once again. Never having to answer to voters in a future election, more “flexibility” to alienate and abandon our longstanding allies such as Israel and Poland, and continuing to issue Executive Order after Executive Order to do what he can’t get through the elected representatives of the people.
The main cause of concern is that if reelected, this President would do harm to the country not for eight years, but for more than forty. As Americans who deeply care about the United States as founded, Barack Obama must be defeated.
“We hold the power, and bear the responsibility. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.” – Abraham Lincoln, 1862
