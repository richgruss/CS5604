Emanuel’s top aide mo'in' from City Hall t'mayor’s re-election campaignThar Tale be told on December 23, 2014 | By Ye Cap'n 
 Mini-Rahm be makin' t'move from City Hall t'Rahm Emanuel’s mayoral campaign.
Da'id Spielfogel be a trusted mayoral ad'iser who has emerged as Emanuel’s alter-ego while spearheadin' virtually e'ery 'un o'ye mayor’s policy initiati'es.
They range from ethics reform, ride-sharin' an' petcoke t'raisin' t'minimum wage t'$13 an hour by 2019 an' gi'in' mo'ie mogul George Lucas 17 acres o'free lakefront parkland t'build an interacti'e museum.
Mo'in' from City Hall t'yonder campaign will give him yonder freedom t'defend thar mayor’s first-term record an' articulate Emanuel’s vision fer another four years.
“I’ve been wi' t'mayor fer more than four years. I have a very good sense o'his record an' vision fer ye future. His campaign be goin' t'be focused on those two thin's. Bein' at t'campaign will allow me t'defend his record an' talk about his vision in a way I can’t at City Hall,” Spielfogel said.
Spielfogel said 'un o'his jobs at ye Emanuel campaign will be t'help prepared ye mayor fer debates.
Ald. Bob Fioretti (2nd) has called fer five debates, but none has been agreed t'or scheduled.
“O' course thar will be debates. T' mayor be very much lookin' forward t'speakin' directly t'voters jus' as he has been fer ye last four years, an' ye debates will be a grand part o'that. Last time, we did four or five. It’ll be about yonder same this time,” he said.
A former policy chief-turned-senior ad'iser t'har mayor, Spielfogel said his move t'yonder Emanuel campaign does not mean his days in city go'ernment be over.
“Thar’s nothin' more rewardin' than workin' in a city fer a mayor who be willin' t'ake on yonder entrenched bureaucracy an' make t'ough decisions. I’m lookin' forward t'returnin' in t'sprin' an' helpin' him implement that vision if he’s fortunate enough t'be re-elected,” Spielfogel said.
Earlier this year, Spielfogel was thar subject o'a Chicago Sun-Times stuff that identified him as Emanuel’s intellectual match an' “go-t' guy.”
Spielfogel’s cellphone starts rin'in' wi' calls from thar mayor shortly after Emanuel completes his predawn workout. It doesn’t avast rin'in' until 10 each night — an' only because they’re both such early risers.
“Thar’s a special relationship thar. He’s almost like Rahm’s alter ego, a mini-Rahm: studious, geeky, Jewish,” said a co-worker who asked t'remain anonymous. “Da'id be able t'whip t'gether a program that triangulates politics, communications an' policy. Yonder mayor has a special affection fer that because that’s wha' ye mayor does. Yonder mayor relies on him hea'ily.”
Like Emanuel, Spielfogel hails from a family o'o'erachievers.
His mother be Dr. Carol Ober, a Ph.D. an' chairman o'yonder Department o'Human Genetics at ye Uni'ersity o'Chicago.
His father, Keith, be a criminal defense attorney who recently defended former Chicago Police Officer Ste'e Mandell against charges o'buildin' a torture chamber t'castrate, mutilate an' murder a businessman whom Mandell was allegedly tryin' t'extort. A federal jury found Mandell guilty o'those charges, though he was acquitted in a separate, similar alleged plot.
After graduatin' from yonder Uni'ersity o'Chicago Lab School, t'Uni'ersity o'Michigan’s School o'Natural Resources an' ye London School o'Economics, Spielfogel worked as an energy an' en'ironmental policy aide in t'Clinton White House.
A two-year stint as chief o'staff fer yonder MacArthur Foundation was sandwiched between four political campaigns: Howard Dean’s crash-an'-burn 2000 presidential race; Barack Obama’s winnin' 2004 campaign fer t'U.S. Senate an' Alexi Giannoulias’ failed Senate race in 2010.
On yonder night Giannoulias conceded t'Republican Mark Kirk, Spielfogel was wi' t'losin' candidate until 2 a.m. Six hours later, he joined Emanuel’s mayoral campaign.
Yonder political marriage was arranged by John Kupper, Emanuel’s longtime political consultant, who had worked wi' Spielfogel on Obama’s Senate campaign.
Spielfogel said his first meetin' wi' Emanuel was “a rapid-fire 25 minutes on a lot o'ideas he had an' how we would package those t'gether t'fit his o'erarchin'” themes: safer streets, better schools an' ‘in'estin' hea'ily’ in Chicago’s agin' infrastructure.
“He’s e'erythin' e'erybody says he be,” Spielfogel recalled when asked about his first impression o'ye mayor.
“But despite wha' people say, he’s pretty collaborati'e when it hails t'new ideas an' how t'make them reality,” he said.
Giannoulias said he ad'ised his deputy campaign manager t'ake a break before jumpin' headfirst into another pressure-packed campaign. But Spielfogel didn’t listen.
“Typical Spielfogel, he wanted t'be part o'a campaign o'someone he really belie'ed in an' move t'city forward,” Giannoulias said.
“Da'id be 'un o'yonder most gifted an' competent indi'iduals I have ever worked wi',” he said. “It’s a rare combination o'bein' truly intelligent, but also ha'in' a huge heart an' genuinely carin' about public policy. He’s a true belie'er. He’s under t'radar. But he’s very influential an' 'un o'ye greatest hidden gems o'this city.”
Spielfogel be yonder most influential o'a large number o'openly gay employees in ye Emanuel administration. On ye day in June 2011 when ci'il unions became legal in Illinois, Emanuel performed 'un o'Chicago’s first fer Spielfogel an' his partner, Lee Crandell.
In t'story, Emanuel acknowledged that he rarely makes a move without consultin' Spielfogel.
“Since Da'id joined my campaign in its first few weeks, he’s helped me t'shape city hall’s agenda on e'ery major priority. Our first discussion in 2010 was about a range o'ways t'break from t'past an' move this city forward. . . . Whether on t'campaign, or runnin' my transition team, or now in City Hall, I have come t'value Da'id’s opinions, insight, ad'ice an' focus,” Emanuel said wit' email.Ye can lank to this tale: Beya Sharin'
