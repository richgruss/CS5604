Pretty good, but not great

    Vodio is not a "curator" as their description states because a curator selects works of art for a museum or gallery based on a comprehensive & developed understanding of the genre or genres from which those works will be selected.  Vodio is an aggregator -- it collects works, in this case, videos from different sources, and the selection is hit or miss, mostly miss.  However, if you want a TV like "experience" where the show just keeps on going, it is adequate.  Maybe you like to sleep with your TV or radio playing all night long & you want your iDevice to do the same thing. Vodio will do this.  But if you want meaningful selection, you'll have to do that yourself or get a real human to do that.
  



Good video watching

    This is a great app to go to for recently-created video clips. It's not the most attractive video app, in my opinion, but the smooth interface plays the sharpest videos of any video curating app I've tried. They make it easy to find the content you are interested in. Easy to share videos too. I would like to see a better design, though. Also, I emailed them with a question once and I never heard back.

    With Vodio you can keep track of the latest news in whatever you're interested in, very easily. The App works smoothly and you're going to hooked on it. The only option that has been missed out is the option of downloading videos. Don't hesitate to install it!
