Egat ordered to evacuate affected villagers from Mae Moh power plant
Only those who are willing to be evacuated will be relocated outside the five-kilometre stripe from the mines and power plant.
EGAT was also ordered by the court to install a water curtain about 800 metres long from the site where leftover soil were dumped to prevent airborne particles from the lignite mines and emissions from the coal-fired power plants from spreading into the environment threatening the health of people living close vicinity with the Mae Moh power plant project.
Coal mines which are already closed down will be rehabilitated by Egat to return the mines into their old natural settings.
The legal tussle between Egat and villagers affected by pollutants from the coal mines and coal-fired power plant at Mae Moh dated back to 2003 when when the affected villagers sued Egat in the Administrative Court seeking redress from mining power generation fallouts.

Politicians impeached or guilty of election cheats cannot contest the next elections
CDC spokesman Kamnoon Sitthisamarn said Wednesday that another new provision proposed by the CDC was that in order to win an election a candidate must get more supporting votes from the electorate than the “No Vote” ballots casted in the poll.
Regarding the provision on the termination of the membership of the MPs, the CDC had proposed that memberships of the MPs would come to end after the House dissolution by the prime minister after he was censured by the parliament.
Kamnoon explained the above provision means that the prime minister was obliged to dissolve the House after he was censured in the parliament.
Asked whether former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra can contest the next election after the expiration of the five-year ban from politics, the CDC spokesman said it was still unclear because the National Legislative Assembly which impeached her was not an elected organization.

Smuggled elephant tusks and ivory products seized
The smuggled elephant tusks and other restricted items were displayed at a press conference held by Bangkok Custom Bureau today.
They are elephant tusks, elephant ivory products, inhalants, pornographic items, sexual stimulants, Baraku, and electronic cigarettes. These products were smuggled into Thailand between October 2014 and February 2015.
Director of Bangkok Custom Bureau Prayut Maneechote said custom officials seized 7 cut elephant tusks, 34 carved tusks and 435 pieces of varying sizes of tusks in the past four months.
He said the cut tusks were sent via mail  to Thailand from Africa.
He said officials  also uncovered a new tusk smuggling route into Thailand, pointing out that some of the items had been sent from Nigeria to Malaysia via the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and then into Thailand.
The carved tusks and ivory products were smuggled from Japan, the United States, England, Belgium and Morocco, he said.
The bureau is now working  with the National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation Department to find out receivers of these items.

Supreme Court reverses death sentence for two convicts in murder of Aussie auditor in 1999
Earlier in 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the death sentence for  two convicts, Somchoke Suthiwiriwan and Sompong Buasakul ruled by the first court.
At today’s hearing of the Supreme Court’s final judgement of their appeals, the court reversed the death sentence for Somchoke and Sompong after their appeals has ground to listen to.
It then handed down life sentence for both of them.
But for the first defendant, Boonpan Suthiwiriwan, the court upheld his life sentence handed by the appeals Court.
All were former executives of Kasetthai sugar mill in Nakhon Sawan.
The three and the sugar mill owner, Pradit Siriviriyakul, were charged for masterminding the murder of 58-year-old Wansley. He was shot dead on March 10, 1999, while on his way to audit the books of the sugar mill in Nakhon Sawan.
Only the owner Pradit Siriviriyakul was acquitted after the first court gave him the benefit of doubt.
According to  the indictment filed with the court in 2006, Pradit hired Boonpan, Somchoke, Sompong and hit man Somchai Jaihao to kill Wansley because he had uncovered financial irregularities in the business, which was in the process of debt restructuring. Somchai has been tried and given a life sentence by Nakhon Sawan Court.
On September 5, 2006, the lower court sentenced Boonpan to life, condemned Somchoke and Sompong to death and acquitted Pradit. The public prosecutor and co-plaintiffs then submitted an appeal to get Pradit punished while the three other defendants appealed for acquittal.
The Appeals Court was told Boonpan arranged for a motorcycle and a gun, while Somchoke and Sompong helped the alleged gunmen Somchai and Pichet Khaewsamduang (who was acquitted by a lower court in a separate trial) in fleeing to Bangkok. The Appeals Court upheld the lower-court rulings handing down a life sentence to Boonpan and death sentences to the other two men.
Finding weakness in evidence against Pradit, the Appeals Court upheld his acquittal by the lower court on benefit of doubt.
