PETALING JAYA: The 2014 DAP National Conference today passed several amendments to its constitution, which included increasing women participation in the party's decision-making level to 30%.
In his winding-up speech, DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said the amendments were vital in recognising the growing roles which women currently played.
He said this was also important, especially in garnering women's votes in the next general election.
As part of the move to strengthen the party, the conference also saw the amendment of the party constitution to increase the number of elected central executive committee (CEC) members to 30, from the current 20.
It also passed a proposal to increase women participation in the party's decision-making level to 30% to ensure that at least nine out of the 30 elected CEC members are women.
The new amendments also see delegates agreeing to limit terms for state chairmen to three terms or nine years.
"A limit of three terms for state chairmen is a move to ensure continuous renewal and rejuvenation of the party and train leaders at state level," DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said in his policy speech when opening the national conference in Subang Jaya near here.
It will also extend terms for state committees from two to three years in order to align with the CEC, while terms for branch committees will be extended from one year to two years.
The party's parliamentary liaison committees are revamped with election coordination in mind to better prepare for electoral battles. – Bernama
