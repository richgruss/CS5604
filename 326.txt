URGENT CALL TO ACTION-LEFT WING GROUP TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT SCOTUS AND RIG ELECTION PROCESS




URGENT CALL TO ACTION...LEFT WING GROUP, BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE,  IS TRYING TO RIG THE SYSTEM AGAIN BY GOING AROUND THE SUPREME COURTS RULINGS ON VOTING RIGHTS.  


LET CONGRESS AND THE SENATE KNOW THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE KILLED.  IT IS JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT BY THE LEFT TO RIG OUR ELECTION PROCESS AND MAKE IT EASIER TO COMMIT VOTER FRAUD!



POST ON THESE LAWMAKERS FACEBOOK, TWITTER, ETC.  GET THE WORD OUT AS THE BILL HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BY THE MOST LEFT WING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, JOHN CONYERS AND PATRICK LEAHY AS WELL AS REPUBLICAN JAMES SENSENBRENNER.


THIS IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE: 


Latest Developments

Congress Introduces Voting Rights Act Bill

Today,
 Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), with 
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and others, introduced a bill to strengthen the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court eliminated its key protections last year.



“From its first days, the 
Voting Rights Act united members of both parties. Critically, this 
proposal continues that bipartisan approach,” said Brennan Center 
President Michael Waldman. “America was founded on the 
principle that we all are ‘created equal.’ To fulfill that promise, we 
need an election system that works well for everyone, and doesn’t 
tolerate discrimination against anyone. This bill is a crucial first 
step. We hope it gets stronger as it moves through the legislative 
process.”



Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,
 jurisdictions with a history of discrimination must seek pre-approval 
of changes in voting rules that could affect minorities. This process, 
known as “preclearance,” blocks discrimination before it occurs. Last 
June, the Supreme Court invalidated Section 4 — which determines the 
states and localities covered by Section 5 — arguing that current 
conditions require a new coverage formula.



Today’s bill would, among other changes:


Require jurisdictions with a recent record of repeated Voting Rights Act violations to pre-clear election law changes.


Expand the current “bail-in” procedures, which allow courts to subject jurisdictions to preclearance. 


Create a uniform requirement to inform voters of certain pending voting changes.


Enhance the ability of lawyers to halt discriminatory election measures before they can harm citizens.   (Allow voter fraud by not requiring ID)


Allow federal observers to monitor elections to ensure compliance with laws protecting the rights of Americans who speak limited English.

State Updates


Arizona – The Associated Press
 spoke to several voters caught up in Arizona’s fight over its 
documentary proof of citizenship law, which the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated last year for federal elections.

Kansas – Kansas has a similar problem. More than 19,000 registrations are on hold due to the state’s proof of citizenship requirement. A group of Democratic legislators introduced a bill to fix the problem. Jean Schodorf, a former Republican state senator who had voted for the law, is now demanding an audit
 of Secretary of State Kris Kobach’s supervision of the measure. “He 
promised that this
law would be simple, easy and seamless to implement,” said Schodorf, who
 switched parties and is expected to challenge Kobach as a Democrat. 
“We’re in this horrible mess.”

Alabama – State officials last week agreed to provide voter registration opportunities at public assistance agencies. Read more here. Meanwhile, a federal judge used a mechanism in the Voting Rights Act to reinstate federal oversight of voting laws in Evergreen, Alabama.

California – “Conservatives and Tea Partiers” are trying to put voter ID on the ballot this November, according to MSNBC.

Florida – State
 election officials will soon start efforts to remove non-citizens from 
the voter rolls, but this time election supervisors will have a chance to
 opine on the plan. Voting advocates and the Justice Department sued to 
halt a purge in 2012 after the supervisors found the lists were riddled 
with errors.

Iowa – State Senator Tom Courtney (D) wants to investigate
 whether Secretary of State Matt Schultz (R) properly used federal money
 to investigate voter fraud charges. But the agency that can conduct an 
investigation, the Election Assistance Commission, currently has no 
commissioners. Courtney sent a letter last week asking the U.S. Senate’s
 Judiciary Committee to confirm the nominees.

Kentucky – A state House committee approved a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to those with past criminal convictions. The bill, which is backed by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R), needs 60 percent of the vote in the House and the Senate to be placed on the ballot this fall.

Mississippi – State Sen. David Blount (D) believes there will be bipartisan support for his bill to offer online voter registration.

North Carolina – The NAACP broadened its lawsuit
 challenging North Carolina’s package of restrictive voting laws, 
arguing the measures discriminate against Hispanics as well as African 
Americans. The group is also asking for access
 to Republican lawmakers’ emails to show the bill’s “sponsors knowingly 
discriminated against racial minorities.” The state says the emails 
should be private because of legislative privilege.

Ohio – The legislature will consider
 a series of bills to restrict voting, including a measure to eliminate 
Ohio’s “Golden Week,” the one week where a voter can register and cast a
 ballot on the same day. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) 
reached a settlement in which he agreed to use an interstate database to identify ineligible voters on election lists. Advocates worry the program
“makes it too easy to wrongly remove voters from the rolls.”



Media Round-Up

The courts will consider a number of voting rights
 issues in 2014. “If judges have to rule whether new restrictions are 
inspired by party politics or racial motives, it will be difficult to 
predict what they will say,” wrote UC-Irvine Law Professor Rick Hasen at
 TPM.
 “But the impeding rulings will make a huge difference for minorities 
and younger Americans, whose voting rights are very much on the line.”



“If I need ID to buy cough syrup, why shouldn’t I need ID to vote?” Brennan Center Fellow Andrew Cohen breaks down his answer to that flawed question at The Atlantic.



Single-party control of 
state governments is leading to radically different approaches on a wide
 range of issues, from voting rights to labor contracts to health care, reported Dan Balz of The Washington Post.



The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony last week from Debo Adegbile,
 former head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who was nominated to lead 
the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Stanford Law Professor Pam Karlan will oversee the Division’s voting section, which handles the federal government’s voting rights policy.



The Nation’s  (COMMUNIST PUBLICATION) John Nichols highlighted the Brennan Center’s recent report, How to Fix the Voting System, as one of his “five reforms to make our politics matter.”



“Online registration is 
cost-effective for states, convenient for voters, and secure, because it
 reduces the potential for fraud while improving the accuracy of voter 
rolls,” according to new report from The Pew Charitable Trusts.

Voting Rights Act Bill: Critical First Step to Improve Elections






January 16, 2014





Voting Rights & Elections

Voting Reform Agenda

Restricting the Vote





Today, members of Congress introduced a bill to strengthen the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court eliminated key protections last year.

The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law released the following statement from President Michael Waldman:

“The Supreme Court gutted the core of the Voting Rights Act, removing
 a critical protection against discrimination in voting. We applaud 
these members of Congress for introducing this bill to help strengthen 
the law. Reps. Conyers and Sensenbrenner, as well as Sen. Leahy, have 
shown tremendous leadership. From its first days, the Voting Rights Act 
united members of both parties. Critically, this proposal continues that
 bipartisan approach. Voting rights should not be a partisan issue. 

“America was founded on the principle that we all are ‘created 
equal.’ To fulfill that promise, we need an election system that works 
well for everyone, and doesn’t tolerate discrimination against anyone. 
This bill is a crucial first step. We hope it gets stronger as it moves 
through the legislative process.

“We also expect the president’s bipartisan voting commission to issue
 recommendations soon, which states can adopt quickly to improve 
elections. We look forward to working with members of Congress and 
election officials across the country to modernize voting and bring our 
system into the 21st century. We should assure that only eligible 
citizens can vote — but every single eligible citizen can vote.”

To better understand why this bill needs 
to be killed, take a look at what the Brennan Center For Justice thinks 
about our Constitution: 

A New Constitutional Vision








The
 Brennan Center plays a central, critical role in the drive for a 
renewed democracy and justice system. Our goal: To advance a robust 
vision of the Constitution as a charter for a thriving democracy. Bold 
policy reform must be supported by a long-term effort to shift legal 
doctrine. That is why we lead an ambitious new initiative to develop and
 articulate a compelling progressive jurisprudence for the 21st century.

This starts with our multi-year drive to roll back Citizens United. We convened what The New York Times called an “A list” of First Amendment scholars to begin to chip away at the ruling’s foundations, which led to our publication “Money, Politics, and the Constitution: Beyond Citizens United,” the first major book to assess the constitutional way forward. The Center previously published, “The Genius of America: How the Constitution Saved Our Country and Why It Can Again.”

The Center also holds numerous public events centered on the Constitution. Created in 1996, our annual Brennan Center Jorde Symposium
 sponsors top scholarly discourse and writing from a variety of 
perspectives on issues that were central to the legacy of Justice 
Brennan. Our Living Constitution Lecture series brings together thinkers and policymakers to further understanding of the Constitution and its role in a changing world.

The Brennan Center forges new doctrines not only in the halls of 
academia, but in the active fight for justice. We play the lead legal 
role in defending the integrity of our elections, coordinating the legal
 strategy to defend voting rights, working with civil rights and voting 
rights allies. Through lawsuits, advocacy, and research, we have 
protected voting rights for hundreds of thousands of Americans. We also 
insist on a fair and impartial judiciary, working hard to protect the 
courts from the influx of special interest spending that threatens to 
overwhelm judicial selection in the states.

By developing this kind of progressive legal scholarship, the Brennan
 Center has real impact in the academy, in legal practice and 
jurisprudence, and in the public debate on policy issues.
