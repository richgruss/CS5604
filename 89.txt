    I'm just starting with this app; so I'm still learning about it. But so far, I'm very happy! I love being able to have multi windows open on my iPad. It's great not having to close down Twitter, then open FaceBook, do my thing, and then go back, etc. etc.. It's time consuming & irritating! But, with Socialbox - problem soved! Plus I love that the Twitter part works exactly the same as the one on my phone: simple, clear ... and without all the congestion.I highly recommend end this app.
