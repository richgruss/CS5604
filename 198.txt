Right before his Election Missouri Prosecutor Robert McCulloch uses Campaign Money to buy Ads and make Donations to a Police and Sheriff Association; Something He has never done in 14 Years according to estimate 70 documents before the Michael Brown murder by Police Officer case

In 14 years Missouri Prosecutor Robert McCulloch has never made any campaign expenses to any Sheriff or Police association until after the Michael Brown shooting on August 9, 2014. In all of those 14 years and an estimate of 70 documents from 2001-2014, elected Prosecutor Robert McCulloch finally made campaign expenses on September 10, 2014 in the form of donations to the St. Francois Sheriff’s Association and bought Ads with the Florissant Police Welfare Assn.
Prosecutor McCulloch actions would reflect more sympathy for Officer Darren Wilson rather than Michael Brown Jr., whom he was supposed to be seeking justice for.
I’ve looked at an estimate of 70 documents filed since 2001 of similar documents like below concerning McCulloch exepentitures and campaign donations and I saw not once until the death of Michael Brown in August 2014 had Robert Mcculloch shown in any form expenses concerning the Police and Sheriff Associtation.
The expenditures while not large, doesn’t elude the fact Robert McCulloch was prosecuting the murder case of Michael Brown Jr. in which Police Officer Darren Wilson was responsible for his death.  The Missouri law enforcement backing Wilson has been deeply involved in the case.  It certainly raises the question using campaign expenses to influence votes by reaching out to the Police and the Sheriff association as a conflict of interest.  Just how far would Prosecutor Robert McCulloch go to protect his seat in office.
On September 23, 2014 call it an afterthought MCCULLOCH FOR PROSECUTOR COMMITTEE also made donation to Crime Victim Advocacy.
