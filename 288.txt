History[edit]
Medford was founded by Hobart Johnstone Whitley, a land developer, banker, farmer and Rock Island Railroad executive.[citation needed] The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma states only that the town name was for Medford, Massachusetts, which it says was the home town of a railroad official.[5]
Before the opening of the Cherokee Outlet to non-Indian settlement on September 16, 1893, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway (later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad) built a line from southern Kansas that passed through the future Medford townsite in a north-south direction. A post office was established October 31, 1893. The townsfolk voted to incorporate on March 10, 1894. In 1897 the Gulf Railroad (later the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) built a line that passed through Medford from northwest to southeast.[5]
Voters in Grant County chose Medford as the county seat by an election on May 27, 1908. A courthouse was dedicated July 4, 1910. A fire destroyed five blocks of businesses and residences on June 25, 1911.[5]
Geography[edit]
Medford is located at 36°48′23″N 97°44′13″W﻿ / ﻿36.80639°N 97.73694°W﻿ / 36.80639; -97.73694 (36.806457, -97.736918).[6] It is located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 81 (Chisholm Trail Highway) and State Highway 11.[5] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), all of it land.
