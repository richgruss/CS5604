Carl J. Petersen for LAUSD School Board
"One of Galatzan’s most outspoken opponents, Carl Petersen..." - Los Angeles Daily News
"If Carl Petersen does not win the crowded LA Unified school board race for District 3, it certainly won't be because he was not aggressive enough."- LA School Report
I have fought the LAUSD bureaucracy for my kids.
Now I want to fight it for all students!
 
Empower Parents * Respect Teachers * Protect Taxpayers
“Everyday parents...don’t really care who’s on the school board.”
- Tamar Galatzan, LAUSD School Board Member, District 3
The parents that I have spoken to do not agree with this statement. When we see a poorly designed and implemented student management program like MiSiS cause students "to suffer severe and pervasive educational deprivations," we know that the members of the Board are not properly supervising the Superintendent. When badly needed construction bonds are used to buy iPads while students sit in classrooms with broken air conditioning and leaky roofs, we know members of the Board are not practicing fiscal responsibility. When valuable instruction time is used to provide students with sugar-filled, heavily processed "food" instead of providing nutritional meals in an environment designed to serve food, we know that members of the Board are not putting the needs of the students first.
“When you get down to it, who cares who’s on the school board?”
- Tamar Galatzan
On March 3, 2015, let's show her that we want a school board member that DOES care.
