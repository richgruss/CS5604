Tai Chi Roots


Dec. 24, 2013



									In my new blog I connect the Roots mini-series to genealogy, history, 
									truth versus fiction, religious mythmaking, and the nature of truth versus 
									reality.  Somehow Tai Chi makes it into the mix -- 
									
									I'm not much for holiday TV fare, but today's showing of Roots, in all its flawed glory, 
									was special.  The show brings memories of thanks and of lessons learned about the study of 
									the history that we care about, our own.  At the end of the TV mini-series, when I learned 
									Roots was a story that emerged from Alex Haley's personal quest, I thought, if the 
									descendant of a slave can learn so much about his past, surely I can learn as much!

Martial Arts:  Why Do We Train?


Nov. 11, 2013



									What is the purpose of martial arts: Fighting, preservation of a 
									historical culture, or character refinement? All are viable reasons, 
									depending on the practitioner's goals, but a small moment of training 
									recently illuminated a wide array of controversies and concerns in 
									the practice of martial arts today. I was invited to participate 
									in a black belt workshop in historical Japanese jujitsu.

Are You Fit?

									Are you fit? My friends and family think I am fit, 
									â€œespecially for your age,â€ but for me, watching the Pumpkinman 
									Triathlon two weeks ago was Part Two of a wake-up call. 
									Part One happened the week before, when I participated in a black

The Two Faces of Tai Chi


May 20, 2013



									Tai Chi Chuan evolved as a vigorous martial art between two hundred 
									and three hundred years ago - but now, throughout the world, it is 
									primarily known as a gentle exercise practiced by people with physical 
									shortcomings due to age, infirmity, or nature. Thus we have the 
									yang and the yin of Tai Chi, which embodies the Theory of Opposites. 
									
									Although I have trained extensively in external martial arts, after 
									a long personal struggle I yielded to my true nature, which lies 
									with Tai Chi. What has caused me even greater difficulty is accepting 
									the true nature of Tai Chi. Peter Wayne manages in his new book, 
									The Harvard Medical School Guide to Tai Chi, to strike a path 
									that helps point the way. Let me explain.

															Essential #6:  Mind Over Matter
															


February 22, 2015



															Our next essential carries into all parts of your life: the idea that you must 
															use your mind to direct your actions.  To some this is a philosophical notion; to many 
															it remains an obvious truism though without obvious application to life; but 
															to those of us devoted to the study of tai chi chuan it is a governing 
															principle.  As such it is one of the easiest to echo, but one of the most 
															difficult to acquire.  Full acquisition means you 
															are stepping into the arena of advanced attainment.

February 19, 2015



															In my last column I highlighted the problems of overcoming established obesity. 
															 Diet will always be the main culprit in creating the problem, but we have good news 
															 from a survey of recent data in New Scientist magazine:  fresh meat does not have 
															 bad health consequences - not red meat, not any kind as long as it is fresh. 
															 Processed meats like sausage and bacon remain dangerous.  One study alone involved 
															 a half million Europeans in 10 countries, providing a database that is wide and deep.

															The implications for the long-term obese are

Are You Watching TV as Much as TV Watches You?

															If you knew that your smart TV's voice recognition system allowed the TV listen to

															A lot of consumers are counting on disabling the offending features, as Samsung has 
															recommended to its customers - but who knows if you're really disabling it?  And if you

Who's Hacking Your Phone?
															
February 9, 2015




															We've learned in recent months that the FBI and NSA feel entitled to hack your 
															phones calls and text messages without a search warrant - because America isn't about
															freedom any more, right?  Wrong!
															Truth is, there are plenty of bad actors out there who can hack you with the same technique 
															of using a dummy relay station  for your phone, so even a Tea Party patriot 
															should be on the look out.  You can fight back with an 
															Android app, SnoopSnitch, available for free in the Google Play Store. 
															It only works on phones with the Qualcomm chipset, but other than than you're good to go.
															With SnoopSnitch you can snoop on the snoops, stalking those who are e-stalking 
															you.  And once you discover that going on, it may be time to buy a burner!

															Golden Son:  Red Rising Book II (Pierce Brown, 2015)
															


February 8, 2015



			Any sequel to a novel must navigate carefully between a tedious repeat of the first book's success and a departure so 
			great as to negate the value of a follow-on story.  Golden Son, Pierce Brown's second book in the trilogy begun with 
			Red Rising, walks this line carefully.  For the uninitiated, Red Rising begins the story of an attempted revolution against 
			Mars' oppressive caste system.  Mars' denizens die in the color-coded career caste to which they are born.  In this system the 
			lowest are the Reds, the miners of Mars, and 
			the highest are the Golds, the kings, princes, and generals constantly jockeying for power on Mars and throughout the solar system.

To Kill a Mucked-Up Book
															
February 6, 2015




															Fans of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird were surely heartened at first to 
															hear she has another book coming out in short order - a prequel to her first and only 
															book today.  As the details trickle in, though, a disturbing pattern emerges.
															
															To begin with, any writer knows that if they are sitting on a manuscript for 60 years - imagine that! - 
															there must be a good reason it never came out.  Lee, who is in cognitive decline, clearly did not make the 
															decision to release this book, which by all accounts has not been edited.
															
															I've heard a couple of versions of how Harper Lee came to get To Kill a Mockingbird published, but they come 
															down to this:  her editor thought her writing, which was episodic and story-based, needed a lot of work.  
															Supposedly this "new" novel was written before TKM - that would probably make it the early writing that her 
															first editor rejected.  From that we can conclude that Lee had good reason not to publish the work.  We won't know 
															until it is released, but it could well damage her literary repuation if that is the case.
															
															When an author's editor says he did not edit the book and only saw it after it was ready for publication, that's 
															a bad sign.  I hope for Lee's sake this matter gets sorted out properly.  Sadly, in this case that probably means 
															not publishing at all.

															A Mad Catastrophe: The Outbreak of World War I and the Collapse of the Habsburg Empire, Geoffrey Wawro (2014)
															


January 23, 2015



															In the last year we have passed many one-century milestones marking the beginning of 
															World War I, known then as The Great War.  That 
															decade was a remarkable time, resulting in the fall or reconfiguration of many dynasties 
															and empires - the fall of the Habsburgs, 
															the Ottomans, the Russian tsars, the Manchurian rulers of China, and the first German reich; 
															the decline of British influence; and 
															the rise of America as a world power.  The Italians and Ethiopians were affected, but 
															to a lesser extent.  The realignments 
															that followed, including continued Chinese weakness during its brief flirtation 
															with democracy, led to the rise of the Japanese 
															empire.  To all but the most dedicated history buff, not to mention quite a few 
															historians, the Eastern origins of World War I have long

															Last month I began a series of columns starting with the general question, 
															does Tai Chi have standards?  From there 
															I proceeded to write individual columns about each of Yang Cheng-fu's

															In my latest column I discuss the tai chi essential ingredient to loosen the waist.

															Essential #3:  Relax the Waist
															


January 3, 2015




															A key secret to the power of Shotokan karate is the use of the hip in completing 
															a punch, often a reverse punch.  Most karateka and taekwondo students are taught this 
															hip movement, but many beginners find it unconvincing because their teachers cannot 
															explain why.  If you know about the use of the hip in karate, without an understanding 
															of why you use it, you will find it tough to separate from the idea of 
															using your waist, 
															not your hip, in tai chi.  If you have no karate background you will not have 
															this problem; instead other problems will emerge.
															
															Put your hip into the karate punch because the angular momentum arising from the twist 
															will provide last-minute acceleration to the punch, increasing the force (force 
															equals mass times acceleration).  In tai chi our punching power is derived by 
															totally different methods, so our use of the waist has different reasons as well.

1. The Interview is a terrible ambassador for free speech.  This bumbling

															want to support free speech and come out of the theater feeling uplifted instead 
															of dirtied, 
															

go see Selma instead.
															


2. If you went to see the movie to show Kim Jong-Un he could not tell you what 
															to do, you failed.  He coerced you into seeing a bad movie.  Your bad!
															
3. North Korea may not even be behind the hack attack on Sony.
															A prominent computer security firm has reported to the FBI that the job was 
															performed by Sony ex-employees working with piracy hackers.  Word is the so-called 
															Guardians of Peace

															The Essence of Tai Chi
															


December 8, 2014



															What is tai chi chuan?  We must ask this question with tact because it is a 
															sensitive matter.  A lot of exercise passes as tai chi that probably 
															is not, often taught by people who have no idea what tai chi is.  At the same time 
															many advanced practitioners hold opposing views about 
															what tai chi is or is not, and what it should or should not be. Chen style 
															practitioners famously advocate tai chi's martial methods, 
															although they are not alone.  Others claim exactly the opposite, that tai chi was 
															never, or at least should not be, a martial art.  
															This is easy to understand among those who have never been taught martial methods, 
															which is increasingly common.  Others conduct 
															classes in sitting tai chi, or wheelchair tai chi.  Who is right and who is wrong?  
															More importantly, is there even a right or wrong?  Does anything go?

															to look.  When I started wearing the Stogie Memorial Bracelet I was both comforted 
															and saddened by the familiar sound of the tinkle. Within a few sessions, however, 
															I realized a deeper truth:  the better my practice, the less the tinkle.

															Stillness is the essence of what we seek in tai chi as well as meditation, though it is less obvious with tai chi, a 
															physical exercise 
															of movement.  Since music is energetic and generates non-stillness, it is difficult acquire deep focus while 
															musical or video distractions are at hand.  That said, it would not be tai chi if an absolute could so easily be spoken with truth.

															start over.
															
															Media pundits have tried to characterize the two tragedies as a one-two punch to the civilian
															space program.  In reality they were two very different events.  Neither will be long 
															lasting, but the recoveries will be quite different.  Let's start with the manned mission of 
															Virgin Galactic, which justifiably received the bulk of the attention,
															 and then work back to the Antares explosion, which was 
															unmanned and different in many other ways.

TV Childhood Traumas
October 27, 2014




															We all know that deprivation or trauma in early childhood can leave a child with a warped emotional
															and value system for the rest of his/her life.  Now in ultra-violent cable TV shows we are 
															seeing directors honestly playing out child-centered story arcs 
															that result from the bad deeds that their 
															daddies do, or that the daddies are victims of as well.  We saw it first on Dexter, when 
															Dexter Morgan's toddler was witness to the brutal bathtub slaying of his mother, 
															playing out a 
															scene not much different from Dexter's own childhood - which lead to Dexter becoming a 
															serial killer.  With that ghost haunting us, who else might be lurking?
															
Bruce Wayne, obviously.  He saw not one but both parents gunned down in cold blood.
															Coming from a wealthy, entitled and otherwise idyllic childhood, we can assume the jolt was
															sharper than was Dexter's or his son's.  Increasingly in the Gotham episodes we find the
															adolescent boy obsessed with crime in Gotham, obsessed with identifying gangs, 
															gang leaders, and killers - 
															and uncovering the political and financial muscle who enable them.  Inevitably he
															realizes the culpability of 
															Wayne Enterprises itself, now a billion-dollar football for any captain who can gain control of the 
															ball.  This story line threatens to become highly unrealistic in its handling of business - comic 
															bookish, one might say, as more of a criticism than a recognition - because Bruce's 
															"butler" and presumed foster father, Alfred Pennyworth, seems to know things only an executive 
															would know.
															
															As usual the most brutal work is saved for Sons of Anarchy.  While the gang members and 
															their rivals blow each other way in machine gun battles and far worse, SAMCRO President Jax Teller's 
															son Abel is quietly absorbing and reacting to the violence surrounding him.  
															He sees everyone around 
															him violated or killed, including his mother; at one point he (3 years old?  4?) tries to stand 
															guard to defend his 
															sleeping baby brother Thomas, wielding a hammer with a vengeance - 
															not because he was crazy but because he correctly perceived that they were all in danger all 
															the time.  The crushing blow came this week when 
															Abel overheard his grandmother, the psychotic SAMCRO den mother who killed his mother, secretly 
															confess her crime to baby Thomas, not knowing Abel was listening.  Now Abel knows her secret, 
															which surely will point us to the end of the series:  
															anyone who knows anything about young children know that they can 
															never keep secrets, especially big ones. That bright light up ahead?  
															It's a train headed straight our way.  Stand to one side and watch a terrible calamity.

Oswald Cobblepot





October 17, 2014



												Tv Update:  
												
Gotham continues to be of interest.  The character development of the 
												strange Oswald Cobblepot, aka Penguin is the first realistic treatment of thie character I
												have ever seen: the Tim Burton (Danny DeVito) and TV (Burgess Meredith) versions were a sick joke.  
												
												This young man brings 
												the idea of Penguin to life.  Meanwhile, young Bruce Wayne continues to develop in a brash, 
												iconoclastic manner typical of neither his age nor class.  What strange ideas lurk in this boy's mind?
												
												On 
Sons of Anarchy the body count continues to rise as Jemma's killing of Tara has consequences far 
												beyond anyone's imagining - with the exception of producer 
												
Kurt Sutter, of course. This week we had 
												a fakeout death for Jemma.  How long can we put up with such nonsense?  The depopulation of 
												northern California will continue for seven weeks, to be precise.

									Dale's Doggies Die
									


October 15, 2014













Stogie's Regal Pose



																		What is it about dogs that make them so special to us?  My family always had dogs and cats 
																		when I was growing up, so I took dogs for granted.  As a Cub Scout I once read six dog 
																		books in a week, until my mother tried to put a stop to my obsessive-compulsive reading 
																		tendencies that emerged right around that time.  But I never had a dog as an adult, mostly 
																		due to living in apartments, I thought, because I would not have a dog without a yard.  As 
																		I dig into my own psyche, I wonder if the reasons go deeper.
																		
																		This year, living and working alone in a house in a small, desolate town in the middle of a harsh 
																		desert, I decided to get a dog for company.

												With this redesign of the website I begin journalling with daily entries.  I will continue to write the column-length 
												articles I have been calling blogs in addition to the day to day insights.
												
Sunday, Oct. 12 I returned from the 

												Indie Recon Live 
												in Salt Lake city.  IRL was a self-published writers' conference, live 
												for the first time; the first two years were online only.  This was a great start with 300 people and dozens of workshops: expect it 
												to be an annual event, possibly 
												in a couple of different regions.  For the self-published writer, ordinary writers' conferences are a waste of time and 
												money.  IRL overcame both problems handily.
												
												It ended in tragedy with the hit-and-run death of my dog and best friend, Stogie, outside Salt Lake City.

Gotham:  New kid on the block



																		As I finish launching the publication of White House Storm and move into my final edit of the sequel, Queen Joan, I'm reading less 
																		and turning to current cable TV more for inspiration.  Such a wild and woolly scene it has become!  Soon it will be all but impossible to recall 
																		the days of childhood in the 1950s and 1960s, when TV was so timid that Jack Parr was forced to leave The Tonight Show for making an oblique 
																		reference to a "water closet" - a popular euphemism of his day for speaking of a room with a toilet.  Today we call them bathrooms 
																		(or "half-baths"), which is funny because water closet is actually more accurate.
																		
																		I'm going to try my hand at a short weekly blog with comments on the events and prospects for my favorite shows.  This week we 
																		have a lot to talk about starting with a Jump-the-Shark episode for the Season 4 premiere of Homeland.

									A Crippled Presidency
									


September 2, 2014
















																		Who runs the government when the president is incapacitated?  The easy answer is the 
																		vice president, as Acting President under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, but 
																		suppose there is debate over whether he (or she) is truly incapacitated.  Suppose, like 
																		Ronald Reagan in his second term, his cognitive impairment is border line, "manageable".  
																		Suppose the Cabinet is split down the middle over the issue.  What happens?   
																		Basically, nothing.  But what happens when the President's confidantes start scheming 
																		to take advantage of the situation?
																		
																		That actually happened once at a critical time for American in world history.

August 25, 2014
















																		Are you are considering the self-publishing route for your book?  If so what's holding you back?  For some, it might be the cost; for others, 
																		it might be the overwhelming desire to see their books on the shelf of bookstores, before they all close down; but for most, I suspect, 
																		the problem is that they don't want to become publishers.  They don't need the hassle.  They just want to write, and see their writing 
																		in print.  I can sympathize.

									The Tyrant of Cable
									


August 14, 2014
















																		The last decade of cable TV has seen remarkable growth, perhaps more than we want or need, 
																		given The Walking Dead and The Strain.  As shows like The Sopranos, The 
																		Shield, Breaking Bad, Dexter, 24 and soon Sons of Anarchy literally die off, 
																		we are seeing new suspenseful thrillers with high octane but more implied than actual 
																		violence - shows like Homeland, The Americans, and now Tyrant.  All have an 
																		overseas tie-in that help leaven the stories.

									Hacking the Weapons
									


August 8, 2014










															Reports of large-scale cyber hacking have become so common that the latest round - of 1,200,000,000 
															user names and passwords from 400,000 websites, for an average of a mere 3,000 per website - still 
															fails to feel like the wake-up call that our Internet-addicted society needs if it is to survive a 
															real cyber war.  
															
															Three months ago I thought perhaps a TV show like 24, depicting what happens when a terrorist 
															group hacks a fleet of drones, then uses them for international blackmail and mass murder, would 
															serve the purpose.  Then I realized we've become too put off by the psychochotic behavior of Kiefer 
															Sutherland's Jack Bauer to take it seriously either, even though tens of thousands of lives 
															were putatively at stake.  
															
															Consider instead the stories of real-life drone hacking ...

									Comics Begin
									


August 1, 2014












															Hollywoodland is growing stale from the success of its comic book movies, enough that there is reason for concern even if you are an uber-fan 
															like me. To get right with it all, I have to return to my roots. My earliest memory of comic books comes from 1963, the year I turned nine.
															  Going through the checkout line at the Carswell Air Force Base commissary I spied a silver anniversary special issue of Superman, which 
															  my mom surprised me by buying.  Supes was 25 that year, a number that would have seemed impossibly old except Mom was already a whopping 30.
															
															Later that year I discovered a Fantastic Four comic at a local pharmacy, #24, a story about "The Infant Terrible", an alien infant with 
															unimaginably catastrophic powers.  Even then I had a discerning eye for narrative consistency and could see no way that Reed Richards could 
															concoct an intergalactic communications device that would, first time out, work perfectly to contact the infant's parents across countless light 
															years.

									Who Will Challenge Hillary?
									


June 26, 2014










															Remember President Muskie?  Yes, former Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, Hubert Humphrey's running mate in the near-miss 1968 election against Richard Nixon 
															and Spiro Agnew.  By 1970 the media and Democratic intelligentsia had all but crowned Muskie President, a sure thing who could not be challenged.
															  It was too soon after Chappaquiddick for Ted Kennedy to run, and few wanted to face the long odds of challenging a strong incumbent President like Nixon.  
															  Muskie was to be the Democrats' Great White Hope.
															
															But reality stepped in.  During the campaign for the New Hampsire primary, Muskie and his wife were attacked personally by the Manchester 
															Union-Leader newspaper, New Hampshire's primary media outlet.  At a press conference, Muskie wept real tears (later claimed to be snowflakes), 
															offended by attacks on his wife.  His reputation for calm and composure was shattered.  He would 
															have lost fewer votes if he had simply shot the right-wing owner, but in any event he was finished, and Humphrey himself had to run to stave off the McGovern 
															challenge.  Humphrey lost to the best-organized campaign since his defeat by Jack Kennedy's primary romp in 1960.  Humphrey was a well meaning but 
															fuzzy-headed liberal who believed in spending but not counting.  George McGovern and his campaign manager, future Colorado Senator Gary Hart, were counters.
															
															Now we have Hillary Clinton, crowned the presumptive nominee and President by today's equivalent of the same media-political intelligentsia who anointed Muskie.

									Reading the Movies, Part III
									


June 20, 2014










															A while back I began a three-part series on Books That Made the Movies - best-selling books 
															that became movies.  Typically we readers see the book before the show, such as my early 
															reading of the Dexter series, and our expectations are set accordingly.  Some movies, however,
															I have read only after the fact.  My reflections on both versions are much different for the 
															change in order.  For my final set of books I have not full reviews or 
															even mini-reviews, but reflections of the differences or similarities I found most striking.

									Character Matters
									


June 10, 2014










															Today is the Primary Day in Nevada. In this campaign cycle I have seen behavior that defies
															all reason, but that's par for the course in politics. Conservatives and liberals trade
															places, and beds, with an abandon that would make Alfred Kinsey blush.  Over the years I've
															come to realize that issues come and go; they change in form and substance.  From the time
															of a campaign to the time the elected takes office, much can change that substantially
															alters the point of view that a candidate might need to take on an issue.  The final
															legislation will certainly be crafted with different wording from that posed on the
															campaign trail.
															
															Consequently, the only reliable barometer for behavior in office is character.  Look inside
															a candidate's character to see how they will behave when issues arise that are different
															from what arose during the campaign.  Look inside to see how they will respond under pressure.
															Character can be measured on many levels, as noted by the saying that "an honest politician
															is one who stays bought."

									Tai Chi and Balance, Western Style

															As a young student I mistakenly believed that centering was a mental-spiritual idea and

															that balance is first physical. From physical balance can arise mental balance, and from mental
															balance can emerge spiritual balance. I say "can" because more work is needed after achieving
															physical balance, but by taking the first step you make the later steps possible.

Six Amendments, by John Paul Stevens
									

May 5, 2014










												Lately politicians and pundits have been piling on with proposals to amend the Constitution.  Particularly curious is the phenomenon of
												activists who show their support for the Constitution by demanding that we change it.  Last year we were inflicted
												with the ranting of conservative talk show host Mark Levin (The Liberty Amendments, 2013).  More recently we have Philip K.
												Howard (The Rule of Nobody, 2014), who wants to break government deadlocks by giving the President the power of a dictator.
												






												Into this fray steps retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, with his new book Six Amendments.  Compared to the
												aforementioned politicos Stevens steps gingerly indeed, with proposals couched in legal nuance.  Consequently he wields far more
												authority through care and diligence than the others achieve through bluster.

Book Review: Flash Boys, by Michael Lewis


April 24, 2014



									I remember that day in October 1987 when the stock market crashed.  Since
									I was not in the market at the time, I stood outside the event, watching,
									wondering if this would lead to another depression as it had almost 60 years before.
									I was young with a wife and child, financially unprepared, and completely at the
									mercy of what was to come.
									
									I got lucky:  Neither depression nor recession were in the cards, but the crash
									did lead to clumsy attempts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to shelter
									small time investors from the effects of such events.  Those attempts in turn
									led to a federally mandated computerized trading system that foreshadowed the

Book Review: Ike's Bluff


Jan. 6, 2014



									The popular image of President Eisenhower, which he cultivated, was that of 
									a genial golfing grandpa who hung out but did little.  This image is crushed 
									by Evan Thomas' new work, which depicts Ike as an active, aggressive, egocentric
									leader who did everything himself because he felt he was most capable. In 
									most cases, he was probably right.
									
									Ike was a bluffer in bridge and poker, but not so much so in foreign policy.
									In that regard the book's title is a bit disingenuous, but in any case this 
									works informs on many fronts.

									Jack Kennedy learned to live with death from an early age.  Like many second sons,

									for the presidency from an early age.  He was frail and of ill health; even during 
									college special arrangements were required to make it possible to keep up with 
									studies while spending extensive time in the hospital, where he almost died.  Only 
									Joe Junior's premature death pushed him into the family limelight.  He was so thin, 
									so fragile, that he looked like a kid until his late thirties, when cortisone shots 
									filled him out and gave him a seeming appearance of newly found maturity.
									None of this was public knowledge on the day he died.

Culture:  Longevity Lessons


July 23, 2013



									A long time ago I read an Isaac Asimov story portraying a future society with human life spans extended by several centuries.  The effect on society was to slow social and scientific progress in equal proportion:  Feeling no rush, people took their time.
									
									Further adding to the problem was the fact that children could no longer look forward to the deaths of their parents, which can be a key event in freeing people to become themselves.  Nothing turned over; nothing changed.  Estates were not inherited; offices were not succeeded to.  Civilization stagnated.
									
									Although the average life expectancy is still twenty percent less than a century, we can already see some of the social effects that Asimov projected with such prescience.  The problems caused are hardly devastating, but they are telling.  And growing.  In the case of the institution of marriage, much suffering occurs.
