NASA to build a floating city above the clouds of Venus 
Venus exploration has been deemed off-limits due to its inhospitable climate - but NASA believes Cloud City may be the answer.
About 31 miles (50 km) above Venus' surface, the gravity is only slightly lower than Earth's, and the atmospheric pressure is about the same. What's more, Venus is better shielded from radiation than Mars.
The vehicle designed to explore the atmosphere is a helium-filled airship that runs on solar power. The idea is to send a robotic version, followed by a larger, crewed version. The airship would have to be folded up inside a spacecraft to get there, with humans following in a separate vehicle. The plan even includes a suggested space colony, floating in the clouds.
