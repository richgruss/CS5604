DeLauro money-laundering
scandal Continues to unravel! 
Husband still implicated!

Earlier this week DeLauro brushed past reporters as she entered a diner,
refusing to answer questions about the explosive revelation
that for 24 years she has laundered $Millions and $Millions
of campaign donations into her husband’s business
—thereby essentially paying herself with campaign donations.
A do-it-yourself post recently was placed on the internet,
allowing Anyone to “follow the trail” of her campaign money #scandal ,
money which is “transferred” to the DCCC,
which then pays this SAME money incrementally to her husband’s business.
Full, step-by-step instructions can be found here:
https://rosadelauroexposed.wordpress.com/money-trail/ 
This scheme has allowed DeLauro to accumulate personal wealth now exceeding $26 Million!
And has allowed her to live a luxurious lifestyle
—paid for almost entirely with laundered campaign funds:

“It’s certainly pretty obnoxious.
It’s a circuitous way of getting money into her own pocket,
there’s no question about that.
She should notify her donors, ‘if you give me money, I’m going to transfer it,
I’m going to transfer big buckets of what you give to give
to the congressional campaign committee,
who then hires my husband’.” (Cleta D. Mitchell, ethics law & campaign finance atty, Washington-based Foley & Lardner LLP)
“It’s just a one of those classic one-hand-works-with-the other,
I-scratch-your-back-you-scratch-mine deals that
I think have made a lot of people very cynical about politicians”.
(Charles A. Pillsbury, who ran against DeLauro on New Haven’s Green Party ticket in 2010)
“It doesn’t look good, and, quite frankly, it smells rotten”. (Atty Hans A. von Spakovsky, leader of Civil Justice Reform Initiative)
“It’s not just a conflict of interest, it just looks bad.
It looks like she’s raising money and giving it to herself. This is what Washington is now.”
(Capital Univ. Law Prof. Bradley A. Smith, former FEC chairman)
[quotes from Human Events which 1st reported this scandal 3 years ago]
➡  The story continues to be SUPPRESSED by local news sources such as New Haven Register and New Haven Independent; the Human Events article recently was spammed—by a DeLauro video.
George Mason U. Law Prof. Jerry Brito:
“Constituents will no doubt ask of their member, what is the story here?
The member of Congress would have to explain what happened.”
➡  But DeLauro adamantly REFUSES to do so!
This author has sent DeLauro emails, letters and visited her New Haven office
—and she has refused to explain why such money laundering should not be considered
Unethical and Deceitful.
ADDITIONALLY, she has been asked how she still can consider herself a legitimate “representative” of the typical CT 3rd district constituent
when her high-end lifestyle,
financed with the aforementioned laundered campaign donations,
has caused her to become utterly out of touch with most voters.
DeLauro likewise has refused to respond.
THE OTHER “conflict of interest” that DeLauro refused comment upon is that,
despite her recent bills to coerce “healthy eating” such as a soda tax
her husband Stan Greenberg long has worked for
Monsanto: the largest producer of GMO seed and toxic herbicides.
Greenberg ALSO was involved in “greenwashing” BP’s image
—shortly after BP’s devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

In recent years DeLauro has attempted to divert attention from this unscrupulous connection
by frequently ranting about “Big Oil”
—because “Big Oil” funds DeLauro’s household through her husband, 
rather than through laundered campaign donations.
This provides a convenient way for DeLauro to “discredit” oil companies
—while actually benefiting immensely from them herself.
The BP “greenwashing” contract alone, which involved DeLauro’s husband, 
was worth $200 MILLION.
Over the years this author repeatedly has tried to get a response from DeLauro
regarding these various unethical conflicts 
as well as the abuse of her political office for massive financial gain.
She either ignores the questions, changes the subject or merely responds
“I’m very proud of my husband’s business.” End of topic.
DeLauro also refuses to comment on her false accusations that the
#Ebola crisis has been created due to “inadequate CDC funding”
—despite significant evidence to the contrary
[see https://rosadelauroexposed.wordpress.com/ebola-lie/ 
OR the oct 17 post here: https://www.facebook.com/RosaDeLauroCronyism ]
The New Haven Register, in recently endorsing DeLauro, utterly OVERLOOKED

her unethical campaign money laundering
her #crony connection, via husband, to BP and Monsanto
the fact that she was partially involved in the UnitedHealthcare fiasco by not being proactive regarding Medicare Advantage policy requirements
the fact that DeLauro was unaware of the scandalous conditions at the VA—until outside sources had to break the story
DeLauro’s immense ill-begotten wealth that has caused a total disconnect with voters
that she hypocritically pretends to be an outspoken critic of #incomeinequality and “Big Oil” as she throws about empty “slogans” such as #RaiseTheWage or #WomenSucceed
And finally—the fact that not ONE bill DeLauro has introduced in 24 years has become law!

In its endorsement, The Register stated that DeLauro “has always shown herself to be honest and trustworthy.”
Apparently the Register’s editor doesn’t read the news very much… 
Additionally the Register stated that DeLauro “places herself front and center where it matters most: in the issues that affect the daily lives of Americans.”
So go down New Haven’s Dixwell Ave. or Howard Ave. and ask people what they think about reforming the criminal justice system—a system which has been responsible for the disappearance of entire generations of young black men
—an issue that DeLauro has NEVER raised in 24 years.
How about the failed War on Drugs? Which likewise contributes to #MassIncarceration of minorities and a literal #BlackHolocaust .
—ALSO an issue that DeLauro has NEVER raised in 24 years.
It is the fraudulent, corrupt, emptiness of careerist politicians like DeLauro that has caused a growing number of voters to demand #TermLimits and to call for voters to #RetireRosa .
➡  DeLauro’s opponent—James E. Brown 
—is appearing on the Nov. 4 election ballot in row A, column 2 James E. Brown
—immediately under Representative in Congress Vote for One .
As this story was being released
James E. Brown was unavailable to make a statement
re. DeLauro’s misappropriation of re-election campaign donations
or DeLauro’s unwillingness to comment on her husband’s BP & Monsanto connections
or her “too-little-too-late” responses to the UnitedHealthCare and VA debacles.
While James Brown thus far has not moved past standard GOP ‘talking points’, Brown’s election nevertheless would be the start of slowly eliminating the deceit and cronyism that has polluted Connecticut politics for far too long.
