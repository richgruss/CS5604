Take America Forward Act would build 50 states, not fed deficit 
THE SIMPLE WAY TO TAKE YOUR COUNTRY BACK AND GROW PRIVATE-SECTOR JOBS
In this 2010 film, I set out the elements of a Take America Foward Act.  On November 6, 2012, that proposal will be more relevant than ever.  Elect me November 6 by giving me your vote, and I'll make it law.  We'll take America forward!  THIS is the plan with the vision for our renewal.  Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for President, supports this basic approach in 2012.  Vote Mitt Romney and Steve Carlson November 6.


Time for Tea Party?  Or Republican establishment?

 I am grateful to God that he has given me a chance to advance these needed ideas and discussion as Minnesota votes to select a junior Senator in Washington. I am offering everything I can so you can see how the U.S. Senate can work for Minnesota and for the United States. Thank you for your visit.
