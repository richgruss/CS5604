General Election Campaign 2015






 80-95% of people living with MND will experience some loss of speech before they die. Too many people experience significant delays in getting the right communication equipment, leaving some people with MND to die without a voice. We recently launched our #SelfieAgainstSilence campaign action urging Health Minister Norman Lamb MP to take urgent action. Thanks to our amazing supporters, Norman Lamb has agreed to meet with us and discuss what he will be doing to improve access to communication equipment for people living with MND. Find out more. Charlie Fletcher, who is living with MND, talks about why having a voice is important to her. Please watch and share with your friends and family.  In a few months time we will be electing our MPs in the 2015 general election. Now is our chance to influence candidates standing for election and ask them to commit to working with us on this important issue. It only takes 2 minutes to send an email to your candidates urging them to read our manifesto ‘Don’t let me die without a voice’ and support our campaign.  Download campaign materials  Manifesto for candidates standing in the general election. Full length manifesto for policy makers. Manifesto summary for campaigners. Template letter to candidates. Postcard for candidates. Feedback postcard for campaigners who have taken action.
