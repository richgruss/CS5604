GOP Should Revive Yucca Mountain And Nuclear Energy

Nuclear Waste: While Keystone XL remains a focus, the long-stalled repository for spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain, Nev., deemed safe in a recent report, is also good for the environment and for our energy future.
The ghosts of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima continue to haunt and hinder the nuclear energy industry. Yet a report released Oct. 16 may revive both the spent fuel repository and the nuclear energy industry with it.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) report, mostly finished in 2010 but delayed by Yucca Mountain foes such as the Obama administration and soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, says that the facility does meet the NRC requirements for environmentally safe storage of spent nuclear fuel.
Four years ago, the Department of Energy tried to kill the project by shutting down the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which was in charge of the Yucca project. The DOE told the NRC that it wanted the licensing application for the project to be withdrawn, but the NRC's licensing board wouldn't allow it.
Like the Keystone XL pipeline, the Yucca Mountain project, on which upwards of $14 billion has already been spent, has been studied to death. That money would have been wasted.
Then last year, a federal court ordered the NRC to use $14 million in remaining funds to proceed with the licensing process and complete a safety review of the repository in the volcanic-ash mountain, including the safety of long-term storage and any possible risk of groundwater contamination.
Lo and behold, Yucca passed the review.
"Today's report," Illinois Republican Rep. John Shimkus, a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said on its release, "confirms what we expected all along: Nuclear waste stored in that mountain, in that desert, surrounded by federal land, will be safe for a million years."
Yucca Mountain has undergone years of extensive review and has been found to be safe and geologically stable. The spent rods, stored 1,000 feet under a mountain with 1,000 feet of solid rock under them in some 40 miles of tunnels, are unlikely to be disturbed by 9.0 quakes or 40-foot tsunamis as at Fukushima.
Shimkus has a vested interest in that report. About 1,800 tons of spent nuclear fuel rods are stored at the now-closed Zion nuclear plant north of Chicago, a football field away from Lake Michigan.
They are among the more than 70,000 tons of spent fuel stored at more than 130 above-ground facilities in 39 states; 161 million Americans live within 75 miles of these sites.

They are among the more than 70,000 tons of spent fuel stored at more than 130 above-ground facilities in 39 states; 161 million Americans live within 75 miles of these sites.
They're stored in cooling pools or, when the pools have reached capacity, in expensive dry cask storage facilities adjacent to operational reactor sites.
Even if we don't build another nuclear power plant, spent fuel rods from existing facilities will continue to accumulate.
Yucca opponents don't want a safe storage facility, fearing that it would usher in more nuclear plants.
But considering that these same critics claim fossil fuels are ushering in planetary doom via climate change, shouldn't we reconsider a greenhouse-gas-free power source, one that to this day continues to provide around 20% of our electricity and safely powers our aircraft carriers and submarines?
Timothy Frazier, a former Energy Department official who runs the nuclear waste program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said on the NRC report's release that it "makes it hard, based on what they've written, for someone to say Yucca is not technically acceptable."
Frazier added, "If the Senate flips, you're going to get money in the Senate Appropriations bill to do something for Yucca Mountain."
Well, the Senate has flipped. New reactor designs make future Fukushimas and Chernobyls unlikely. Nuclear power has already cleansed the atmosphere of billions of tons of slow-death pollutants.
It can do more. Let's finish Yucca Mountain.
