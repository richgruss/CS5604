In an unprecedented, historic move, Israel’s Arab parties Hadash, Balad, Ta’al and Ra’am announced late Thursday night that they will run on a joint slate entitled “The Joint List” in the upcoming March 17 election.

	 Members of newly announced “United List” of Arab parties in Israel ahead of March 17, 2015 election
The list will be headed by the Arab-Jewish Hadash party’s Ayman Odeh, who was elected party chairman last week, followed by Masud Ghnaim of the Islamist Ra’am and Balad’s Jamal Zahalka in third place. Ahmed Tibi (Ta’al) will take the fourth place, followed by Aida Touma-Sliman from Hadash, the first woman on the list.
Abdel Hakim Haj Yahia (Ra’am) will take the sixth place, and Hanin Zoabi (Balad, and the second woman on list) will be placed number seven. Eighth place will go to Hadash’s Dov Khenin, the only Jewish member of the slate who is likely to be elected, followed by Ra’am’s Taleb Abu Arar.
Yousef Jabareen of Hadash will take the tenth place, followed by Bassel Ghattas (Balad). Ra’am and Ta’al agreed to a rotation for spot 12 and 15, while Balad’s Jum’a Azbarga and Abdullah Abu-Ma’arouf (Hadash) will rotate between spots 13 and 14.
While the different Arab parties have historically run separately, a law spearheaded last year by Avigdor Liberman and Yair Lapid raised the election threshold to 3.25 percent (four seats), and has effectively forced the parties to consider joining forces in order to remain relevant. The new threshold has sparked a fierce debate about the possibility of giving an equal voice to all sectors of the Arab population, as well as the inclusion of Hadash’s Jewish members.
The parties began negotiations over the past dew days, after both Balad and Hadash elected their individual slates. The violent events in the Bedouin city Rahat, where two residents were killed by police, and the protests that came in their wake had an effect on the negotiations.
Following the announcement, MK Haneen Zoabi tweeted: “This is an historic achievement that will bolster the Arab public’s trust in their power and in the political game. [This is] the only democratic list in Israel: 100% for equality, 100% against occupation.” (My translation).
Most of the surveys have the list projected to receive 11 Knesset seats. According to a recent +972 poll, nearly 70 percent of Arabs citizens intend to vote if the three existing Arab parties run on a joint list, compared to 56 percent who voted in the 2013 elections.

A picture taken on August 07, 2014 shows a Palestinian boy who have been displaced due to Israeli bombardments on the Gaza Strip, posing for a photograph in a United Nations school that has been turned into a temporary shelter in Gaza City. Thousands of Palestinians were fleeing their homes east of the city in fear of Israeli attacks, after a 72-hour truce ended. Israeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza, killing a child in retaliation to rocket fire after the truce expired without a breakthrough on a longer-term ceasefire.

The Gaza health ministry has confirmed the deaths of at least 2,137 Palestinians in the besieged strip since Israel began its relentless assault on July 8. Among those killed, at least 577 were aged 18 or younger. More than 90 families have been "massacred" in Gaza in the past days.

According to sources in Gaza's health ministry, 80 percent of the people killed by Israeli forces in Gaza were civilians.

According to the UN, 70 percent of the people killed by Israeli forces in Gaza were civilians.

The youngest victim has been Mustafa Wael al-Ghoul, only 24 days old, who was killed alongside 8 of his family members in Rafah. The next four youngest victims have been two-month old Rizk Abu Taha, four-month-old Mohammed Anas, five-month old Fares Jomaa al-Mahmoum and 8-month-old Sama Nael al-Barawi.

The oldest victim, Mohammed Mazen Faraj Daher, who died on July 31, was 99 years old.

Victims’ names and ages were compiled based on information released by the Gaza health ministry, while the circumstances of the deaths were taken from the ministry and local news sources.

JUSTICE FOR RASMEA:

					ALL OUT FOR MARCH 12!


					Letters for leniency requested by February 4th On March 12, Rasmea is set to appear once again in the Detroit courtroom of Judge Gershwin

					ain, this time for a sentencing hearing. We are seeking letters to the judge requesting leniency. For this round of letters, we are NOT looking for a mountain of individual statements, but rather letters from prominent individuals who represent broader constituencies. We need you to work with leaders of faith-based, labor, women’s rights, and community organizations, as well as student governments, student organizations (national), prominent professors, and legislators in your area to draft and submit letters. Below you will find an outline you can use to draft these letters, but it is important for the authors to write them in their own voices. Letters should be submitted by February 4 to [email protected]. 


					Stay tuned! Keep sharing Rasmea’s story and organizing fundraisers. Watch for calls for your support as we prepare for sentencing and appeal. Our organizing is key to winning #Justice4Rasmea. * * * SAMPLE LETTER TEMPLATE * * * Honorable Judge Gershwin Drain, I am writing to request leniency from you in the March 12 sentencing of Rasmea Odeh, who I know as <friend/aunt/community leader… your relationship to Rasmea>. <AND/OR> • In November 2014, Rasmea was convicted of Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization. Compassion in her sentencing will serve justice in this case. She was detained for a month immediately following the verdict, including almost 3 weeks in solitary confinement, which was extremely difficult for her. • As a survivor of torture, engagement for the betterment of her community in Chicago is critical to her emotional health; the isolation she endured while incarcerated was a great hardship and may have retriggered her Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). • As a 67-year old woman, her health suffered under the cold, damp, and uncomfortable conditions in the St. Clair County Jail, as they surely would in any facility lacking medical services and accommodations to provide for senior citizens. • If Rasmea loses her appeal, she will likely lose her citizenship and face deportation. This will end life as she knows it, cutting all her ties with family and community in Chicago. This punishment alone is so devastating, it should not be compounded by adding a prison term.

								Rasmea Yousef Odeh

								Sign the petition here: Since there is a possibility of her conviction being overturned on appeal, keeping her out of prison would allow her to continue as a contributing and productive person, doing the work that is so critical to hundreds of immigrant and refugee women in Chicago’s Arab and Muslim community. • Rasmea is an award-winning leader of Chicago’s immigrant community who has dedicated 50 years of her life to serving refugees wherever she has lived. In Chicago, she built the Arab Women’s Committee, with some 600 members. Because of Rasmea’s work, immigrant and refugee women who came to the US from countries facing war and political crises – like Iraq, Palestine, Yemen, Syria, and beyond – now have a place to seek support, gain empowerment and community, and call their home. Respectfully yours,
