[PDP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY] President Jonathan wins Election at Eagle Square (PHOTOS)





The Peoples Democratic Party held their primary election at Eagle Square in Abuja today. Current President Goodluck Jonathan will be the party’s candidate in the 2015 presidential election.
The ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,begun its two-day National Convention at Eagles Square, Abuja Today.

One of the agenda of the convention was the ratification of President Goodluck Jonathan as the party’s candidate in the February 14 presidential election and that of Adamu Mu’azu and Wale Oladipo as the party’s national chairman and national secretary, respectively.
Over 3,050 delegates from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory are gathered at the Eagle Square for the convention.
The delegates voted to endorse the presidential ticket of President Goodluck Jonathan.
You would recall that he had emerged the party’s sole presidential candidate in November, amid controversy over the withdrawal of his challengers, Jelil Tafawa Balewa, son of Nigeria’s former Prime Minister, and Akasoba Duke-Abiola, widow of the late Moshood Abiola.
The president was adopted by all the organs of the party, including its governors.
Irrespective of that, President Jonathan in accordance with Electoral Act,Section 87 of the PDP needed ractification through an electoral process to avoid litigations that could lead to the disqualification of the president from the impending contest.
On his part, Mr. Mu’azu, a former governor of Bauchi State, was appointed the PDP national chairman in January following the resignation of Bamanga Tukur from the position.
Mr. Oladipo was inaugurated in September last year.
The last presidential primary of the PDP held on January 14, 2011, at the same venue, Eagles Square.
In that election, Mr. Jonathan slugged it out with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Sarah Jubril.
The result announced by the Chief Returning Officer, Tunde Adeniran, a former education minister, showed that Mr. Jonathan polled 2,736 votes to beat Mr. Abubakar who got 805 votes while Mrs. Jubril got one vote.
Mr. Abubakar has since defected to the opposition All Progressives Congress, APC, on whose platform he is contesting the primary today in Lagos. He is running against four other aspirants.
The president, who went ahead to win the main presidential election, compensated Mrs. Jubril with an appointment as Senior Special Adviser to the President on Ethics and Values.
