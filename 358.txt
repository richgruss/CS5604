2015 Election: Catholic Rev Fr. Joins Politics, to Contest Cross River Governorship
Rev. Fr. Francis Agantem Eworo



In some religious quaters in Nigeria, politics is dirty and, therefore, a no-go area to them.



However, this certainly does not apply to Rev. Fr. Francis Agantem Eworo who has picked up his form to run for the gubernatorial election come 2015 on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He is planning to unseat Liyel Imoke as governor come 2015.
Rev Fr. Eworo, told Daily Independent correspondent that his major area of interest is Youth empowerment amongst others.
His words: “Youth empowerment, capacity building, infrastructurel development, educational pursuit at the grassroots, security of life and property of all indigenes of  Cross River State as well as tourism development will form the anchor-points of my regime.”
The Revered Father, who was ordained a Catholic priest in 1997, and has served in various parishes of the Catholic Church in Ogoja, Ikom, Uruan, Calabar, and Akwa Ibom State,  said that though the incumbent governor has performed creditably well, he will take some giants steps forward.
