21 INEC  Commissioners Reject Postponement Of the 2015 Election






 




Twenty one Resident Electoral Commissioners, RECs, of the Independent 
National Electoral Commission, INEC, have rejected a proposal to 
postpone Nigeria’s general elections billed for February 14 and 28.In
 a vote conducted Saturday by the INEC chairman, Attahiru Jega, after he
 met with political parties and the civil society, 21 RECs said the 
elections should continue as planned while 16 others voted in support of
 a reschedule.Nigeria has 37 RECs, each for a state and the Federal Capital, Abuja.The outcome of the vote came as Nigerians await INEC’s decision on whether the elections are moved or not.Civil
 Society leaders said Mr. Jega had told them at their meeting that the 
commission was under pressure to postpone the polls after all security 
agencies, including the military and the police, warned that they will 
only support polls held at least six weeks after the current dates.Jibrin
 Ibrahim, a senior fellow at the Centre for Democracy and Development, 
CDD, in Abuja, who was at the meeting, said Mr. Jega told the meeting 
that security operatives told INEC that they were commencing a six weeks
 special operations against Boko Haram insurgents in the north eastern 
corridors of the country and would rather not be distracted by the 
elections.Mr. Jega announced that the security forces also said 
the operations are due to commence on February 14, the date INEC had 
planned for the presidential and federal legislative elections.Earlier, 17 political parties out of the total 28 voted in support of an extension.The
 opposition All Progressives Congress, APC, has rejected any plan to 
postpone the election saying such calls are sponsored by President 
Goodluck Jonathan and the ruling party to stave their imminent defeat at
 the polls.It is not clear what the commission’s eventual decision would be with the latest voting pattern by the RECs.Mr. Jega is expected to brief the media any moment from now.
