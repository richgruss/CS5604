#OUR_2014_MIDTERM_ELECTION  Who is going to PROTECT U.S.-CITIZEN VOTERS from the sneaky, horrifying underhanded/covert attack against minority-U..S.-Voters launched by #KANSAS_SECRETARY_OF_STATE_KRIS_KOBACH  --  AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING CONSERVATIVE -- by means of his "PET PROJECT" - iNTERSTATE_CROSSCHECK_PROGRAM

This Link was sent to Twitter 2 days ago by well-known and highly esteemed INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, @GREG_PALAST.  LINK TO ARTICLE ABOUT INTERSTATE CROSSCHECK:   http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/double-voters/index.html   Greg Palast has also recently spoken on Sirius Radio - media not controlled by major U.S. Corporations -- about iNTERSTATE_CROSSCHECK_PROGRAM

#INTERSTATE_CROSSCHECK_PROGRAM IS STRIPPING ELIGIBLE VOTERS FROM THE VOTING ROLL -- MOSTLY MINORITIES.  One method the *Program* uses is to target CERTAIN SURNAMES.   THIS PROGRAM IS A SCAM.  READ HERE:   http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/double-voters/index.html

PLEASE -- if you care about the 2014 mid-term elections -- READ THIS ARTICLE and KNOW what the #INTERSTATE_CROSSCHECK_PROGRAM is doing in the U.S.A.RIGHT NOW.

President Obama, Vice President Biden, Attorney General Eric Holder, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren:  WHO IS GOING TO PROTECT U.S. VOTERS AND OUR 2014 MID-TERM ELECTION FROM THIS POTENTIALLY ELECTION-ALTERING AND ***HISTORY-ALTERING****  SCAM?     YOU ARE CALLED!    PLEASE SPEAK TO THE CITIZENS OF THE U.S. REGARDING THIS AFFRONT TO OUR DEMOCRATIC ELECTION SYSTEM.
