Green party candidate picked for Carlow-Kilkenny by-election.  So the Green Party, or what's left of it here in Kilkenny , has appointed a candidate for the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election.  In case you forgot the Green Party is the one that's costing you two Euro this winter on every bag of coal you buy as part of the notorious carbon tax they introduced with their former butties in government, Fianna Fail, when they both destroyed the country.  And that carbon tax, which is worse than the water charges as it costs us a hell of a lot more over every winter, is mounting up no matter what fuel you use - it's on everything you burn, gas, oil, wood, briquettes, and it's costing you a bomb, and the Green Party brought it in on the supposition of a theory called global warming that has never been proven and that man can not do anything about anyway even if it existed in the first place.  The Green Party also supports the water charges.  They stuck it to you on no grounds at all. And they did this deliberately as they helped Fianna Fail to bring the country down. And the only concession they won from Fianna Fail in their time as butties in government was the stag hunting bill.  The Green Party is even worse than that disastrous calamity of a Fianna Fail government because they deliberately propped Fianna Fail up in government as they did all the damage - and the only thing they got for it was that stag hunting bill. Of course they got their ministerial salaries and pensions, which is the name of the game for all parties and politicians.  The first official candidate running in next year's by-election in Carlow and Kilkenny has been selected. The Green party formally ratified Kilkenny councillor Malcolm Noonan this week to contest the seat left vacant by Phil Hogan's departure to Europe. He is the party’s Environment spokesman since 2011 and has been a Councillor in Kilkenny since 2004 serving as the first Green Mayor back in 2009. He is deputy leader of the party in Ireland.  Recently he refused to attend the anti water charges rally in Kilkenny as the Greens support the introduction of a version of this tax - they were the first to propose a metered water charge in government while their colleagues Fianna Fail mentioned a flat water tax of 400 Euro a year for every house in the country!  It remains to be seen who he will go up against in the by-election next Spring with the other political parties yet to hold selection conventions. He should get a good vote from the anti-CAS people as he has almost single-handedly constructed that serious local campaign in recent years.  Senator Pat O'Neill , the next senior man here in Fine Gael and the farmer's favourite, is battling it out with popular city councillor David Fitzgerald, an excellent former city mayor and the choice of Kilkenny business, to represent Fine Gael.  Fine Gael are still going well in Kilkenny especially now with the upturn in the economy so they'll be in there battling it out with Fianna Fail's former TD Bobby Aylward.  Sinn Fein has to select their candidate still, probably councillor Kathleen Funcheon though they have other councillors to choose from now as well, while there's no word at all from Labour yet as to their likely candidate. Sean O'hArgain? It will be a good opportunity for the right Independent and we think that Councillor Breda Gardner may be tempted to run.
