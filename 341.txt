'I want to have an extra marital affair'
1 hr ago, by Nidhi Dogra








I have been married for over 3 years now and thankfully, life has been pretty good but somehow I think my married life has become too stagnant. There is no fun and romance left between me and my husband. Not that I don't love him but still I often get the urge of having an extra marital affair, just for fun sake.I might sound like mean and infidel towards my partner but that's not the case. I want to know if there's anything wrong in having an extra marital affair without affecting my marriage.

Shocking: RSS blames Mother Teresa for conversion
1 hr ago, by Chitrath Karan










RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's remark against Mother Teresa has
sparked a fresh controversy as he alleged that Mother Teresa's main goal was to
convert people into Christianity. He blamed that she did all this in the name
of service. While he drew a lot of flak on social media for such derogatory
remark, BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi came out in his defence and accused Congress
of trying to make "political capital" out of RSS's comment.I don't understand what is wrong with our political leader

Risks & precautions while using mobile phone
 on Feb 24, 2015 , 05:13 pm, by Dev Kashyap








"Overuse me, and it could be fatal"- Your Mobile. Every morning, the first we do is search for our mobiles with half eyes open. Living without food & water seems attainable but, without a cellphone is a nightmare. Isn't it? As much as we love this technology that helps us bridge gaps, shouldn't we also be cautious & aware of the health risks it poses? I'm sure we all know of the basic hazards of over-using mobiles, but why do we choose to ignore them? Like, don't carry c

Air India flight delayed as minister goes SHOPPING!

This is HORRENDOUS!Just look at the image below! On the left, you have a young girl, who had reached the airport 55 minutes before departure time, and she still was not made to board the Air India flight. Why? Because the officials told her that she was 5 minutes late. This young girl, who was of course a commoner, had her Mphil exam the next day, but still none of her pleas were answered. Now look at the picture on the right. That's Congress MP Renuka Chaudhury. She is a VIP of course so

Shortest horror story: Rahul Gandhi takes a sabbatical!!
 on Feb 23, 2015 , 04:54 pm, by Nivedita Gupta








Just when you feel Rahul Gandhi cannot stoop any lower, he comes up with yet another GEM of a statement! This time, Mr 'Pappu' Gandhi has said he is going to take a few weeks off, to asses the situation in the Congress party. Does Rahul not realise the reason Congress party has deteriorated is because of HIM! I personally feel Rahul Gandhi should not return from his so-called sabbatical! Please retire Mr. Gandhi, maybe then Congress would stand a chance.
