Shinzo Abe has called a snap election for 14th December. Live in Japan? Planning to vote? Let us know your thoughts and tell us the mood in the country.
衆議院総選挙に向けて国内のムードは？今月14日に安部首相の発表した衆議院総選挙の投開票が行われます。日本に住んでいる方、投票に行く予定の方、あなたの意見と国内のムードについて、是非私たちに聞かせてください。
While it may be the economy, stupid, there are other issues bubbling under the surface, from Japan’s pacifist constitution to the future of the country’s nuclear power generation plants. Which is why we’re looking to you to help us build a picture of the country ahead of this surprise election. Where in Japan do you live, and what’s the mood there? Will you be voting in the election? What do you think are the main issues facing Japan, and do you feel optimistic about the country’s future?

Japanese only now learning to be demo-cratic

The 'first past the post' system has been successful in convincing people that there's no point in participating in the voting, that their voice will never be heard. The history of democracy given from above (the occupying US) instead of a memory of one fought for and won from below plays even bigger a role, perhaps. Many are against consumption tax increase for example but, since no one even in the opposition parties or mainstream media talks about income and corporate tax increase or of progressive taxation, most aren't aware of such possibilities, and are made to believe that consumption tax increase is the only way 'out' after all and that they have to accept it at some point anyway; no one except for the Communist Party that is, but supporting the Communist Party is very much stigmatised and voting for them requires courage. 
The elections this time aren't about 'Abenomics' though, the delusion that the last 25 years have somehow been an exception rather than the rule in post-industrial societies; the issues in question are nuclear power generation in this earthquake-prone country, and the constitutional change that the state itself is making (again, many Japanese don't know that the Constitution is different from other laws, that it is supposed to limit state power). Indeed, these are the issues that have prompted some to take to the streets in the past few years and, although the number of participants may still be very small compared to that in the protests in Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc., it has been a steady movement, and genuine demo-cracy is finally being born in Japan, it seems. I only hope that the results of the elections this time will help maintain this momentum.

Our citizen group have campaigned a seal voting on streets: Do you want Abe to stay in power? Yes: 204 / Not decide: 133/  No: 531  In spite of the prediction of landslide victory of LDP, majority of people who answered on the streets are against Abe. The problem is only one in ten people showed interest in the election and most people don't recognize what Abe did in the past two years ignoring public opinion; restart nuclear power plants, secracy bill, collective self-diffence etc... It is people's indifference that would lead our country to the wrong direction. Let's go voting for our true democracy.

We Japanese have next to no choice.

On 21 Nov. PM Abe dissolved the House of Representatives and we have the election for it on 14 Dec. In general, elections with the dissolution have many to do with some turning issues of policy; for example the election in 2005 was said to be the choice whether the privatization of Japan Post is to be operated. However almost all the media consider there is no such issues to choice a particular candidate: if I had to, the point would be whether s/he is the member of LDP ore not.
LDP is often considered to be centre-right, but this is not correct. LDP has in it diverse stands of policy. from right-wing to centre-left (even if their power is not well-balanced). This makes whatever positions of us (farmer, worker, scholar, financier, and so on) be able to agree with LDP's policy in some degree. This trend is not only in these days, but since "the merger of conservative parties (hoshu-godo)" in 1955 founding LDP. Since then almost all days LDP has been in power; it has twice lost power, but both of them are caused by its own scandal and our mistrust of it. DPJ, JCP, SDP, and other new parties, has, we think, no ability of state affairs; we always see them only denunciating LDP and PM at that time with no effective justification, so the informed do not trust them. 
Though the powerlessness of other parties owes to us Japanese because it is the result of our longtime neglect of them, it is too late to prove by experiment whether LDP's policy is suitable to Japan, Asia and the world. All we can do is to see the factional infighting in LDP, right-wing vs. centre-left; both of them are the member of LDP.

The Japanese people should have woken up by the disastrous earthquake and tsunami 3 years and 9 months ago..just the few seemed to be awake for a while but most of them fell asleep as the time passed by and that's exactly our governemnt wants us to do,forget about what's happened,forget about Fukushima and its radiation issues,forget about anything complicated,just watch TV where they never tell the truth and believe in whatever they tell you even if that means you are going to be in a huge trouble in the near future.I myself have been forced to wake up by the nuclear explosions and still am suffering from insomnia and am so fed up with the Japanese ordinary citizens' indifference,ignorance and stupidty.So my conclusion is nobody really cares about the election except for just the few minoritis just like myself.I believe if Abe remains as Prime Minister that means the end of our country.So I'll never vote for his party.I'll vote against his party.It could be any party as long as it can be of any help to decrease the members of the ruling party(LDP) and if possible I hope it will help make Abe resign because he's so evil.His economic policy so called Abenomics failied.It apparantly failed.But he's never admitted it.He's not just evil but a lier.He's been lying to the world that the nuke plants in Fukushima are under control,that is absolutely bullshit.He should focus more on the nuclear issues and help out the people,especially children who are already suffering from tyroid cancer but he hasn't done anything.So inhumane.He only cares about the economy and he hopes to eliminate the sick and the poor,maybe the eldery and the handycapped too.He's that kinda person,an economic animal,the worst prime minister in history.So the mood before the election? Very depressing.Because if Abe wins in this election that means we are going to starve to death in the future.

Now , LDP is too rightwing & "hawk". DPJ is not dangerous. They DPJ are "dove". Non Government party (include DPJ), they are weak to fight election.
JCP grew up from 2011, I like them, but they JCP can't be the Government party, in Japan.
So "dove" people, peaceful people, liberal people, neutral people, left people,a little bit right people, they started talk about strategic voting(DPJ,JCP&SDP), on the web. To stop Abe.
Socialmedia & smartphone changed some people. 2008,9- or 3.11- I feel that LDP have fear about it. Maybe LDP thought that "OTAKU" = "web young people", but it's wrong. Some OTAKU looks like dangerous right wing, but they have poor influence.
But many people on the street, town, easygoing about politics. Usual mood of japan, unfortunately. They are maybe watching TV now.

One private company which most stock held by LDP politicians, is managing everything at the election.  Even governmental election administration commission can not operate the machine.  Another company handles all exit polls.  It means NO MORE FAIR ELECTION in Japan these several years.  Together with government controlled mass media, i.e., TV and newspapers, LDP can manage everything as they want.  We really are in need of international organization to put election under surveillance, otherwise, no hope to have fair election result.  This is what's happening in Japan, sad to say....

There are many older people and getting increase more and less young people. It seems many elders like 50 over years old like LDP, because LDP pretty much led japanese politics after war and developed country. So, LDP is the most trusted party of today's Japan. Even though, young people and some new party or left wings are tries to stop them, it's not the major power to stop them. I myself will vote to LDP, because I can't trust others.

I am very much concerned that Japanese goes down in the near future.
We have a lot of essential issues, for instance , nuclear power plant, an amendment to the Constitution,
right to collective self-defense, secrecy low. I can hardly get the voices about them.   For Abe LDP, those of them are inconvenient matters, mass media , exactly so!,  I guess. The whole media reports LDP's  victory all in one body! If LDP won, they  as a matter of course say "The popular opinion was reflected". 
I want to say to the younger especially "Not having any interests in politics means that you are unconcerned about your own future. Of course, I didn't vote to LDP!(I went early voting).

LDP will win unfortunately, as there is no strong liberal force after the DPJ's fail. The result will cause more divides in Japan. Not just "riches get richer, poors get poorer", but education, political consciousness, or welfare as PM Abe's policy will cut support for low and middle class. The ultimate end will be a country where only terrorism can be an option like the world before World War... Well then, I will emigrate.

Democracy is almost dead in Japan

Many people are feeling that nothing could be better even if they vote. The election system in Japan is making it hard to reflect mass opinions onto the Cabinet's policy-making. Many of us are against joining TPP, raising consumption tax and restarting nuclear power stations, and that has been proved by opinion polls. However, the LDP government changed their policy after the last election. We cannot trust them anymore, but there is no other parties that may take over.
