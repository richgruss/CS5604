Democrats: It’s Panic Time

Stacy Rush  on October 26, 2014 at 10:52 PM

The beltway pundits may reference the latest 2014 election poll to determine whether it’s time for the DNC to panic, the rest of us turn to Twitter.
When engaging on Twitter, the ability to make a pithy point is a must. Each Tweet is limited to 140 characters providing much creativity among its users, including the ever popular hashtag.
Hashtags are used on social media sites to identify messages about a specific topic by using a hash or pound sign (#) in front of a word or phrase.
Examples include topics such as #Ebola, #JusticeForBenghazi4, and #BringBackOurMarine.
With the 2014 mid-term elections less than ten days away, I consulted my trusted Twitter eight ball to answer me the question on the minds of political pundits everywhere. Based on the Left’s latest use of hashtags, how will the Democrats fare in the November election? The Twitter eight ball’s response, ‘outlook, not so good’.
Democrats are pulling out all the stops resorting to scare tactic hashtags, so the internal polling must show all signs point to a GOP victory.
Social media engagement is nothing new for the Democrat party, nor is their use of scare tactics leaving me curious why the Twitter eight ball was certain it would be Panic rather than Hammer Time for the Left.
It seems the party can no longer rely on scare tactics aimed at a single group to vote them over the finish line, Democrats know it is time to either go big or literally go home. Single identity political scare tactic hashes like the #WarOnWomen have been upgraded to ones like #StopTheGOP in order to warn of the dire consequences should the GOP win the Senate in 2014.
The only problem is while the Democrats warn voters of the evil GOP intentions, candidates up for re-election are hammering Obama and attempting to win re-election by pretending they are Republicans.
Thanks to new media‘s success of chipping away at six company’s control of 90% of American media consumption, no longer can Democrats  sweep under the rug hypocrisy like when the party’s SC gubernatorial candidate said during a campaign rally of his opponent, current SC Governor, Nikki Haley(a woman), “We are going to escort whore out the door.”

Now remind me which party has the #WarOnWomen?
Thanks to social media outlets like Twitter, the wonkish, lose them in the details right is FINALLY learning how to craft a message, keep it simple and repeat! And according to the eight ball, the message may be sinking in!
Enjoy!
