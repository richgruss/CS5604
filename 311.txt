As the General Election approaches on Thursday 7 May, ITV News Meridian is working with schools to get young people involved in the political process.
Polling research suggests young people are less likely to vote than older citizens. 
There are calls to reduce the voting age to 16 or 17 and in schools the new National Curriculum now has greater emphasis on teaching how politics works in the UK.
So what is your school doing in the run-up to the General Election in May?


It may be a school debate to fire up lively discussion on a hot topic
You might be inviting local politicians to spark an interest
Are you holding your own mock election?
Some schools make their own video reports on a burning issue affecting young people
You could do your own political survey



Whatever your school is doing, please let us know at ITV News Meridian as we would like to cover some of the events ahead of the election. 
Our email address is: itvmeridianelection@itv.com
