Buying your Way into Canada Buying your Way into Canada        Justin​TrudeauThe NextPrime Minister of Canada    A million bucks and Immigration!!​Thank you Harper, you just put Justin Trudeau into the Prime Minister's chair.  That is if JT and the Gang can play this one out with any sense of power.Duffuss Harper has said you can now buy your way into Canada.  Ain't that just great...if you are a multi-mllionaire.  But if you are one of the hundreds of thousands of the average folks waiting to immigrate to Canada, Duffuss Harper has just told you all you need for a 'quick fix' is go grab a million bucks somewhere and he'll welcome you with open arms.  And what is Duffuss telling Canadians?  He is telling us, his priority is 'money'.  Human values of decency, honesty, hard work, professionalism take a lower priority in his 'scale of human values'.  Who might these millionaires be, Duffuss Harper wants to open the immigration doors to?   Are they doctors...no...teachers....no...professional trades people....no....farmers....no....pharmacists....no....so just who are they?  Lets start with 'where are they coming from'.   From Asia...South America... any third world country...Bangladesh...Vietnam...Korea...where?  Now take any part of the world you'd like and do a currency comparison.  If you think the current USD vs CD is an issue...think of the differences between CD$ and third world countries like Bangladesh.  You don't need a million of your own country's currency to be able to pay the 'entrance fee', you will need tens of millions of your own country's currency to equal the CD$.  While we can't say for sure...we can rest assured that in the foreign slave countries our Duffus Harper has established free trade with, that tens of millions of dollars didn't come from anything other than some form of slave labour company operation.   Now...now...before you start shouting 'rascist'....think about it!   My family is mostly non-white with our family tree stemming from an indentured slave who was kidnapped from his native land, thrown on a ship, stolen from his family who had no idea where he had been taken never to see him again,  transported to South America where he worked as a slave until he could earn his freedom.  I don't think he had a million dollars.  I don't think the people in the slave labour plants provided by Apple, Joe Fresh...shall I list more...have that million dollars....so 'who does'?   And if you are an honest business person with an extra million CD$ in your back pocket, it's very unlikely you are on the 'immigration list'.  You are more likely on the 'tourist list'.  You don't need to be a Canadian citizen to open a business in Canada...you just hire a Canadian....so why would you immigrate?...it is very unlikely you would.    What we do know is that duffuss Harper has opened the Canadian immigration doors wide open to people whose only criteria is money and for that we want to thank him.  Without his elite level of duffussness Canadians, who are outraged at his minor albeit pinnacle point policy because it shows 'exactly who he is and his priorities'.  The Mr. Nice Guy image has been torn off Harper's face and replaced with a cynical, money grabbing, intellectual numbskull...thank you Mr. Duffuss Harper.The only remaining question is who will history have shown to have been the more incompetent...Diefenbaker or Harper.  Maxwell   Home    Copyright © Justin Trudeau  |   Privacy Policy    View on Mobile
