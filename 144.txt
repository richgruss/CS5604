Make Election Day a National Holiday
An Awesome Writer Named Within ArticleNov 20, 2014Opinion, Politics0 Like 



With less than forty percent of registered voters consistently voting in midterm elections and similar percentages in National elections (with an asterisk next to the 2008 election for obvious reasons), the United States needs to figure out a way to get the turnout much higher.
Well… the left definitely wants that to happen because those who consistently are able to vote despite most elections being on a Tuesday are older white americans that have nothing better to do than have an opinion on one or two aspects of a candidate and simply go to the polls to feel like they participated in democracy.
However, most of the left vote is in lower income voters, minorities, most of whom do not have a chance to go to a voting booth every first Tuesday in November. That is either due to the fact they have a job that won’t allow them to take a handful of hours out to participate in real democracy, or don’t feel confident their vote will count at all with many states adopting voting discrimination laws that makes it incredibly hard for Black and Hispanic along with the elderly past the age of being able to drive and attain a current drivers license, to even vote at all.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) Vermont wants to put forth  bill that would make election day a national holiday so that all people would have a chance to participate in their democratic right.
“In America, we should be celebrating our democracy and doing everything possible to make it easier for people to participate in the political process. Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote. While this would not be a cure-all, it would indicate a national commitment to create a more vibrant democracy.
We should not be satisfied with a “democracy” in which more than 60 percent of our people don’t vote and some 80 percent of young people and low-income Americans fail to vote. We can and must do better than that. While we must also focus on campaign finance reform and public funding of elections, establishing an Election Day holiday would be an important step forward.”
