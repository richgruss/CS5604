Right to Vote
The Constituent Assembly adopted the principle of universal adult franchise as the main method of democratic representation in the Lok Sabha and in the State Legislative Assemblies. The original Article 325, providing for adult suffrage fixed the age of eligibility to vote for elections to the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, at 21 years, but by the 62nd Amendment to this clause passed in 1989, it has been reduced to 18 years. It is the fundamental right of any voter under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution of India to know about the candidates they are to vote for. The right includes information of the assets and liabilities as well as criminal past of the candidate. If a person representing himself to be a particular elector seeks to vote after another person has already voted as such elector, he shall, on satisfactorily answering such questions related to his identity supplied with a tender ballot paper which shall be of such design  and the particulars of which shall be in such language as the Election Commission may specify.

Election Process in India
In an election, various candidates of different parties contest against each other, out of which the people elect their representative. The stages of the election process of India include delimitation of constituencies wherein the entire area (the whole country in the case of Lok Sabha elections and that particular state in the case of Legislative Assembly elections) is divided into constituencies. After the demarcation of constituency, the voters’ list of each constituency is prepared and published and nomination papers are filed by the candidates. Thereafter, nomination papers are scrutinised. The next stage is the campaign by all the candidates and the parties. The election campaign ends 48 hours before the polling. The last step is the counting of votes and declaration of result.
