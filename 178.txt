Despite Election and Reality, Senate Dems Still Focused on Climate Hysteria






byStephen Kruiser
Bio






 November 7, 2014 - 4:02 pm
























Laser-like lunacy.
Four Senate leaders on Friday urged President Barack Obama not to retreat from promises of strong domestic carbon cutting goals and significant aid to developing countries to combat climate change given new Republican leadership in Congress, which is expected to be hostile to such policies. 





The Democratic chairs of four Senate committees – Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works, Finance and Budget – wrote to Obama, asking him to uphold promises he made at a high-profile UN climate summit in September.
“A strong target for American emissions reductions after 2020 will build upon our actions to reduce carbon pollution domestically, and convince other countries to help forge a strong international agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties in 2015,” they wrote, referring to the pivotal climate summit set to be held in Paris next year.
Victories in Tuesday’s mid-term elections mean Republicans will take control of the Senate and expand their majority in the House of Representatives, putting Obama’s priority climate change strategy in peril.
Expected Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his first priority will be to “do whatever I can to get the Environmental Protection Agency reined in,” he said, referring to the agency’s proposed regulations to limit carbon pollution from power plants.
Sure, Democrats and their media mouthpieces are paying some lip-service to the results of Tuesday’s elections but they have been mostly proceeding as if they are blissfully unaware that it was all a referendum on the nonsense they have been attempting to foist on the American public for the last six years.
The electorate was quite clear as to what it thinks about the pet issues of the Progressive Media Bubble. While we’re worried about ISIS, the real jobs numbers and border security, they’re banning plastic shopping bags and screaming, “SCIENCE!” like foreign students who just learned one word from the old Thomas Dolby video.
Americans want to focus on real problems, not lining the pockets of Al Gore’s cronies or a war on women that never existed. It is the duty of Republican leadership to make sure that the Democrats understand that right now.
As one president recently put it, “Elections have consequences.”
So let’s hope the GOP can give them some tough-love clarity on that.

Global warming was never a "scientific question" it was a policy mandate, and still is.  It doesn't matter if it is true or not the issue is that wealthy countries must be made to transfer money to non-wealthy countries for their sin of success and oil and coal must never be used, except by Hollywood script readers and leftist politicians and leftist media people  suburban white liberals, who get dispensation to use these things because they are special.

Once it was proven that global warming was a lie, the left switched terminology to "climate change."  But there are too many variables to meaningfully study why the climate changes - as it always has and always will.  Their real goal is imposing economy-killing regulations on the use of fossil fuels, carbon emissions, etc.  The climate-change fanatics are anti-capitalists clothed in pseudoscience.

There is only one logical explanation for last week's Republican tidal wave! It is not climate or the voters' inability to fathom Lord Obama's mind.The explanation is massive, really massive Republican FRAUD! The Pubbies stole it and stole it big time. They stuffed ballot boxes, registered dead and fictional people, had and paid people to vote multiple times and used union stewards, ward heelers, ACORNers and community organizers to enforce discipline and punish transgressors. That's the only possible explanation!And, the dems are going to have to do everything possible to prevent these same tactics from being used in 2016. One approach, of course, to is focus thinking on climate control issues and make the margin of fraud so large that the Republicans can steal another election.

The Worlds top authority and chief proponent of Global Warming, Al Gore, took ONE "Earth Science" class in College. It was Earth Science 100. He got a D.  How damn stupid do you have to be to get a D in a 100 level class? Evidently, not as stupid as the people who are giving him billions to steal their freedom.

"...asking him to uphold promises he made at a high-profile UN climate summit in September."Another one ?  God, they fly in private jets, eat and drink like total gourmands, have been known to almost sink entire Indonesian islands in their indulgences."As one president recently put it, “Elections have consequences.”Just more pontificating there.  Nothing could be farther from the truth when an election goes against his Oneness™.http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/matthew-vadum/obamas-amnesty-by-blackmail/

Many of those in these columns have said what I would say. The one thing I would like to see is a synopsis of all the skullduggery they have used to try to justify their robbery, i.e., substituting computer temps for real ones in the past to make it look cooler back then, the IPCC hockey stick fraud, etc., etc.

The real problem is that whatever the effect of climate change, the progressives want *other people* to live in poverty so that *their* lifestyle won't be affected by it. The progressive liberal will bravely give up plastic shopping bags. He did his part to save the planet. Surely it's ok now to ask the millions of Indian and Chinese peasants yo remain living on subsistence level, right?

"and convince other countries to help forge a strong international agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties in 2015"I thought them dems were against nation building. Are they not doing this in their twisted roundabout way. See what we do, now you do it. Isn't that forcing our lifestyle on other countries?

The politcians who support castastropic global warming from human sources or climate change should be permanently banned from any political office for being the dangerous fools and power hungry fascists that they are. The Earth is basically an iceball with short (by climateology standards) periods of warming where the glaciers retreat. We're in one of those interglacial warming periods and yes, Matilda, the glaciers are and have been retreating for at least 14,000 years and will contiue for another 6,000 years give or take about 6,000 years if our inferential data is correct (a big assumption but the best we have). But our politicians and some scientists, not in climateology by the way, have suddenly noticed glaciars are retreating and atmospheric CO2 increasing and are running around like Chicken Little saying we're all going to die unless we quit using energy and retreat to living in caves like hermit crabs. Even if their claims were true, there is nothing today by human action or in science that could reverse it. Remember in the 1960's when they claimed they'd control when, how often and where it would rain before the next century? Well it's the next century and we're still waiting. Even the best weather models (yes, I know weather isn't climate but the climate models are even worse) can only predict with some probability whether it will rain somewhere near your house 7-10 days from now. How accurately do you think a linear climate model used to approximate a much more complex non-linear process where we don't even understand all the variables is going to be over tens of thousands or millions of years? We can't even say with any accuracy what's currently going on today with our Sun which is a big contributor to our climate. But hey, I'm glad our political elite have finally noticed after 14,000 years that the glaciers are retreating. I'm just surprised that they aren't falling down worshipping them as demi-gods of Gaia, but I suppose that might interfere with their own self-worship.

Climate Science is very complicated, but the issue of global warming is very simple. The tenet of global warming is that the planet will on average continue to warm up. Observations show no warm up for almost twenty years. The observations do not fit the tenet, therefore (ERGO), the tenet has been proven false and so must be sent to the ash can in the History of Science Building.

Also, the CAGW theory assumes warmer is worse and that a little bit of warming will cause feedbacks that make it worse.  The evidence seems to be that feedbacks are stabilizing and that warmer is better for a few degrees up or down.
