Petitioning CHAIRMAN DR. KWADWO AFARI-GYAN and 2 othersThis petition will be delivered to:CHAIRMANDR. KWADWO AFARI-GYANDEPUTY CHAIRMAN (OPERATIONS)AMADU SULLEYDEPUTY CHAIRMAN (FINANCE & ADMINISTRATION)GEORGINA OPOKU AMANKWAAChange the current Ghana electoral register before 2016 election.Susan AkomeahUnited Kingdom659SupportersThe current electoral register as it stands is not credible.
This was demonstrated in the landmark court case between some leading members of the opposition party the NPP and the Electoral commission following the 2012 election.
The electoral commission accepted the use of the NHIS CARD (National Health Insurance Scheme) as an ID to register some people. This card is issued to anybody who resides in Ghana which allows them to access free medical care. The person does not necessarily have to be a Ghanaian in order to apply for this card and there are no checks for Nationality prior to applying for the NHIS CARD.
The courts also found several anomalies in the number of people who voted from overseas i.e. Embassy staff and military service personnel.
Lastly, statically Ghana has the largest percentage of registered voters against the recorded population, compared to other African countries with similar demographics and ratio of children below the age of voting.
Few Examples;
Country                  Population        Registered Voters       Percentage
Kenya                     41,609,728         14,362,189                        34.1%
Senegal                 12.767,556           5,302,349                         41.5%
Tanzania                46,218,486          19,650,412                       42.5%
Ghana                     24.965,816          14,031,763                      56.2%
The above table show clearly that the percentage of the population registered voters in Ghana is the highest among the other countries since half the Ghanaian population are children below the age of 18.
The opposition party went to court when they were convinced that the somehow the election was rigged and the court after sitting for so many months rushed passed a judgement for the acceptance of the election results with recommendations among others to look into the electoral register.
This has not been carried out yet, the next election is in 2016 and the electoral commission has added the newly qualified over 18s to the already doubtful register.
Since the opposition accepted the verdict reluctantly for peace to prevail in Ghana though did not agree with the verdict, my fear is that if a new credible register is not done the results of the next election will not be a true reflection of the people, and this time the losing side will not go to court and this can bring chaos into an otherwise peaceful Ghana.
I entreat every peace loving Ghanaian and friends of Ghana to sign this petition to present to the electoral commission of Ghana to avoid what happens to many African countries who challenge electoral results through other means than going to court which woefully failed the opposition party the NPP during the 2012 election.
Ghana is a peaceful country and must stay the same!
