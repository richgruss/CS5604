Petitioning  Honourable Donald S. Ethell Lieutenant Governor of AlbertaThis petition will be delivered to:Honourable Donald S. Ethell Lieutenant Governor of AlbertaHonour and uphold the Alberta Election Amendment Act (2011).Randy ThorsteinsonRed Deer, Canada337SupportersCurrently there is rampant speculation that Alberta Premier Jim Prentice will call an early provincial election in April or May, 2015 to secure an easy election victory. This is one year ahead of the dates stipulated by law. There is unanimous agreement that the only reason for the election is to take advantage of the disarray of the Wildrose opposition following the defection of 11 Wildrose MLAs to the Prentice government.
The Alberta Election Amendment Act (2011) mandates that a general election, shall be held within the 3-month period beginning on March 1, 2016 and ending on May 31, 2016.
The only way that an early Alberta provincial election can be called is if the Lieutenant Governor “dissolves the Legislature prior to an election”. (www.lieutenantgovernor.ab.ca/141.htm). However, the Lieutenant Governor has a constitutional responsibility to deny a request from the Government of Alberta that "violates Albertans' constitutional rights".
The right to vote in a provincial election that adheres to the Alberta Election Amendment Act (2011) is one of the most fundamental and important constitutional rights that Albertans' have. The essence of democracy is Albertans' right to vote in open, transparent, ethical and legal elections.
The Lieutenant Governor website states "The Lieutenant Governor does not belong to a political party and does not favour one party or its policies over another's." (www.lieutenantgovernor.ab.ca/141.htm)
Should the Lieutenant Governor dissolve the Legislature prior to the March 1, 2016 to May 31, 2016 period stipulated in the Alberta Election Amendment Act (2011) he will be showing favouritism toward the Progressive Conservative Party of Jim Prentice which is unconstitutional.
Premier Prentice himself said that “the timing of an election, as to when it happens, will be driven by what is in the best interests of Albertans, not what is in the best interests of any political party”. (Calgary Herald January 9, 2015)
There are five reasons that an early election is bad for Albertans’ and will only benefit the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives:
1. It is illegal. The next election is legally bound to be held between March 1, 2016 and May 31, 2016. If the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives can ignore a critical election law it sets the precedent that they can ignore any law that isn’t in their best interest.
2. The cost of an election will surpass $18,000,000.00 that in a time economic uncertainty, rapidly declining Alberta Government revenue and looming deficits is a frivolous waste of taxpayers’ hard earned money.
3. Currently the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives have 72 sitting Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) out of a total of 87. In October they won all four by-elections. All political polling firms report that the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives will win a spring election and will enlarge their 85% of MLAs majority. Who will speak for Albertans’ if the opposition is virtually eliminated?
4. Opposition parties in Alberta require the legislated time until the 2016 fixed election dates to prepare for the election; raising money, finding candidates, organizing campaign teams in the 87 electoral divisions. The Progressive Conservative candidates have a distinct advantage over opposition candidates due to the almost unlimited government resources they can use to spread government money throughout their constituencies during the campaign. A fair election can only be held if there is a level playing field for all candidates, where everyone plays by the same ethical rules.
5. Albertans will lose leverage with the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives. The Prentice Plan is to announce a budget in March and hold a snap election, securing the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives an easy victory. The challenge for Albertans is that we do not know if Jim Prentice and his MLAs are capable of managing the affairs of Albertans in these uncertain times. Albertans are better off to hold the election in 2016 as scheduled and make an informed decision at that time. If an election is called this spring the Jim Prentice Progressive Conservatives will be given a four year mandate even if they aren’t capable managers, which definitely is not in Albertans’ best interests.
