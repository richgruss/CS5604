Joschka Fischer
Joschka Fischer was German Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor from 1998-2005, a term marked by Germany's strong support for NATO’s intervention in Kosovo in 1999, followed by its opposition to the war in Iraq.

Europe’s Make-or-Break Year






















BERLIN – The euro crisis, it is said, is over. Calm has returned to financial markets, amid ironclad assurances by the European Union authorities – particularly the European Central Bank – that the monetary union will be preserved. But Southern Europe’s economies remain depressed, and the eurozone as a whole is suffering from stagnant growth, deflationary pressure, and, in the crisis countries, persistently high unemployment. Not surprisingly, given the EU authorities’ obvious inability to end the malaise, many member states are losing patience with austerity. Indeed, some countries are facing a political upheaval.




When the turmoil comes, it is likely to be triggered – as with the euro crisis – by Greece, which is holding a presidential election that seems unlikely to produce a winner. If the Greek parliament does not elect a new president by a two-thirds majority in next week’s third and final round, it will be dissolved and a snap election will be called. The risk is that Syriza, a far-left socialist party, will come to power. To win, Syriza must either mislead its voters about its options, or insist that it will renegotiate the repayment conditions imposed on Greece by the so-called Troika (the European Commission, the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund), all while pursuing unilateral action should renegotiation fail. But any renegotiation following a Syriza victory would undoubtedly unleash a political avalanche in the southern EU that would sweep away austerity and fully reignite the eurozone crisis.Of course, Greece itself is too small for its problems to present any real danger to the eurozone. But the election result in Athens could fuel panic in financial markets, causing a crisis that would threaten to spill over into Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, and, with some delay, France, the second largest.A miracle could occur: a new president could be elected in Athens next week, or Syriza might not win the next parliamentary election. Unfortunately, either outcome would merely delay a politics-induced crisis in the EU. After all, in Italy, too, the signs point to a coming storm – one bearing down not only on austerity, but also increasingly on the euro itself. And after the storm hits Italy, France could be next.The conflict over austerity has become politically explosive because it is becoming a conflict between Germany and Italy – and, worse, between Germany and France, the tandem that drove European integration for six decades. And this is happening at a time when anti-European, nationalist forces are establishing themselves in Germany’s national and state parliaments – and on the streets – thereby substantially reduce Chancellor Angela Merkel’s room for compromise. The battle between austerity’s defenders and opponents thus threatens to tear apart not just the eurozone, but the EU as a whole.The crisis in the eurozone and the refusal to attempt any real European approach to reviving growth has contributed – not exclusively, but significantly – to the rebirth of nationalism within the EU. The strength of this political tendency became fully apparent in May 2014, when anti-European populists performed well in the European Parliament election. The nationalist trend has continued unabated ever since.On one level, this seems bizarre. After all, none of the problems that Europe is or will be facing can be solved more easily alone and at the national level than within the EU and through the framework of a supranational political community. Indeed, nationalist xenophobia is particularly absurd in view of demographic realities: An aging Europe urgently needs more immigrants, not less.It is also remarkable how little Europe has been scandalized by the support that the EU’s new and old nationalists have received from Russia; for example, President Vladimir Putin’s government helped to finance the French National Front via a multi-million-euro loan drawn on a Russian bank. Apparently, authoritarian values and nationalist worldviews (together with a strong dose of anti-Americanism) create ties that bind.It is no exaggeration to say that the EU is currently both internally and externally threatened by reactionary nationalism, which is why the next euro crisis will come in the form of a political crisis. So why are the authorities in Berlin, Brussels, and the other EU capitals still not willing to change their policies, which quite obviously have made a bad situation worse? Observing the EU from the outside is like watching a train collision in slow motion – and one that was announced at the station. And then there is the United Kingdom, moving steadily and with apparent determination ever closer to a “Brexit.” That danger extends beyond 2015; nonetheless, it is an important component of the overall picture of impending crisis in the EU. Regardless of whether the UK ultimately separates politically from the continent, the coming year will mark a turning point for Europe.

The EU needs to fully federalize. If that requires a Brexit, then so be it. The EU needs to have a cohesive federal government, direct federal taxes, direct federal treasury borrowing, a federal court system, and a federal draft for an EU army. The best solution to unemployment is to draft all unemployed youth into the new EU imperial army. This will also bid up wages and create some inflation. And an EU army is necessary now that Russia is becoming more aggressive, ISIS is rising, and the USA is pulling back.

Will anyone in Europe be able to foresee what the new year holds? Although "calm has returned to financial markets," the latest political uncertainty in Greece has caused disquiet  reminiscent of the anxiety in 2012, when Greeks voted on its membership of the euro. Greece has come out of the recession for the first time in six years. Its slight recovery will be damaged by the ongoing political crisis. If no president is elected on December 29, a snap election will have to be held, which would help the far-left Syriza win, because it has promised to scrap  the austerity measures and get a significant chunk of Greece's international debt written off,  if elected. As much is at stake for Greece and the EU, leaders are watching Greece closely, as several member states - France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - are frustrated with austerity and the policies. Like the Greeks, they all believe they have endured enough hardships - job cuts in public sector and savings in welfare spending. Many Greeks will vote for Syriza in a new election. They have been told that Syriza would be able to negotiate with the international creditors from a position of strength. But other leaders urge the voters not to choose Syriza, warning this would jeopardise Greece's eurozone membership.   France's far-right party "Le Front National" sees its EU membership more a curse than a blessing and threatens to take France out of the Union. Following economic growth many Britons complain about the influx of job-seekers and free-loaders from other EU states. This allows UKIP to bank on populism to take away votes from both the Labour and the Tories. David Cameron has to act and vows to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership, if he gets re-elected. EU leaders try to put their worries aside and focus on big investment plans and ways to restore growth across Europe. The new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker has recently presented an ambitious €315bn ($392bn) scheme to boost private investment in infrastructure projects. One problem is that the Commission can only put a small amount upfront, and national leaders are aware that their voters have little appetite for these huge projects in times of economic hardship.

With investment in infrastructure to create jobs to enable the next generation of private businesses coupled with a tax policy that ensures that taxes are based upon the location of economic activity rather than nominal residency and capital gains equated with income taxes, Europe will be fine. But Germany fight for austerity before reform rather than with it and our established elites prefer the tax policies that favour their activities. Instead the policy change is more immigrants for Europe's vampires to suck on whilst the income tax payers struggle along. Too many promises in the past that we will struggle to fulfil based on the promised endless growth.

Don't you think, dear Fisher, that the today EU and mainly Euro-area (why mainly Euro-area?) depression, lasting from 2008 (7 years!) depends on the bad choice of creating a Currency Area without corresponding institutions as State, citizenship, and all what follows?It is what every, every, every, economist all around the world (Europe included) said from years ago, exactly predicting what exactly happened?So, don't you believe that this is exactly a political crisis?You are a federalist, so you can't deny that.And, as a federalist, don't you think that you can't federate everything you want? My dog with my sister with Club Med and Turkey, for instance.Don't you think that there is no way to federate - in a democratic way - the Euro-area countries nor UE countries, unless ruling them under a sort of New Empire?Yes, it is a genuine political crisis, from the beginning, which was more before 2008. The crisis of the way of considering politics as the political European élite adopted: in a few words, politics as wishful thinking (and speaking).The topic isn't if these problems can be "solved more easily alone and at the national level" or not.The topic is that what triggered the crisis in not Greece, but Euro currency and the consequent rigidity in adjusting political, economical, social and contingent huge asymmetries inside Courrency area.This lack of flexibility brought to a lack of democracy - don't you think there is some democracy deficit in UE?So what is destroying UE is Euro, and UE rigidity itself. So one can say that the most anti-European all around the world is exactly the pro-European élite, who brought UE countries to such  outcomes.Why it is so difficult to utter these few words: "I was wrong"? What Mr. Freud is arguing about that?

Eurostat figures show that those living in Belgium suffer the second highest risk of social exclusion/poverty in Europe (63%).  Greece tops the list with a 72% risk of social exclusion/poverty.  So much for the policies of "social cohesion" that the Brussels-based European Commission is supposed to advocate. The malaise of the Eurozone has been laid at the door of the ECB. In fact, the central banks are the scapegoats for a system of political patronage which has resulted in an explosion of the payroll of state bureaucrats that cripples the private sector. Eurostat figures show that the European  state sector consumes taxation to the value of 40% of GDP. The state sector also employs one in six of all workers. This is unaffordable in the context of any economic model. Prior to 2008, cheap money in the Eurozone inflated both a housing bubble and an explosion in the numbers of state employees. Following the asset-price correction on bank balance sheets post 2008, the private sector has contracted and radically reduced inventories. However, the state sector in countries like France and Italy remains as bloated and inefficient as ever. Like Greece, the civil servants are highly unionised and militant. While the private sector has recapitalised and laid off staff to improve efficiencies, the state sector, with its massive voting power, is holding the French and Italian governments hostage in order to retain its outsized privileges. Austerity is desperately needed to bring down the inflated payrolls of the European state sector and reduce taxation, thereby stimulating private sector growth. The clamour for the ECB to expand its balance sheet by bankrolling increased sovereign debt levels is a false flag planted by socialist politicians in order to bribe the state sector unions to vote for the left. George Osborne has "stimulated" the British economy by taking on £1.3 trillion in debt. Barack Obama has "stimulated" the US economy by pushing up state borrowings to  $17 trillion.Austerity is the only way to protect the next generation from servicing the intolerable debt built up by the false economic arguments of the politicians who got Europe into this unholy mess in the first place.

we need the truth mr. Fischer, with no ideological or political  filtering. was austerity a good policy ? are german policy makers to blame for their persistence ? what were the alternatives to austerity and what were the arguments that lead to the final option ? are the economic policies still distorted by ideology ? i understand that the german leadership is denying consumption stimulus policies on the ground that people do not deserve the income stimulus. we need to be more "english", pragmatic, less ideological.

EU will collapse very soon. Germany destroyed all the countries in Europe, not just EU. Don't talk about Greece, its your country that destroyed the planer once again. Now Germany is entering a recession and hopefully, this time nobody will  help you.

Here is a another piece of great misunderstanding if the social unrest. *It doesn't even mention the Luxleak and the fact that major corportation are benefiting greatly from the EU --> big corp doesn't pay taxes* it doesn't mention the fiscal-environmental-social competition between states --> states loose power and go bankrupt* It doesn't mention the lobby industry in brussels.. banks get bailed out, GMOs are imposed, EU is extended without referendum, free trade with USA is secretly negociated by lobbysts (TTIP) and investors will soon be able to sue states for any legislative change.--> EU and Euro is made only for the rich and powerfull, and their highly paid unelected bureaucrates in brussels are just bowing to big Corp. It is not about growth !

The irony is that the core issue is rarely discussed in these formats.  It's erroneously phrased as one of generosity/lack thereof v.a.v. "austerity/anti-austerity" when it's really grounded in issues of corruption and transparency.  To a man, the countries that have had the most difficulty with austerity (rephrased as reform and, better yet, enabling timely and prescient policies) are the same countries where endemic corruption has eroded political confidence, rendering politics inflexible, politicians untrustworthy, and solutions out of reach.  Most voters have stomach for compassion and risk - when it's legitimate.  But lie to them to take money out of their pockets to pad another already padded pocket, and they never forget, regardless how gravely the political class threatens calamity.

The Financial Architecture does not empower the ECB to manage the Eurozone economics, the way the Anglosphere does. Cardinal Principles have created Migratory Millions who have nowhere to go. Brussels is not a Sovereign Capital like London/Washington that can craft 10 New Brussels needed to settle the migrating millions. Brussels can keep its doors shut - unlike London/Washington, who either foster growth of the Capital or create growth in Seattle/San Francisco/Somerset/Sussex that endures settlements for population on the move. Free mobility is a cardinal principle. That needs to be funded with additional Infrastructure. ECB with its current powers is hamstrung. By creating virtual illusions of liquidity on paper, it simple is postponing the inevitable. Real World demands exist and ECB is not empowered to craft the panacea. Super-Mario can become Alexander (Hamilton), The Great. If Europe allows him. Herr Fischer as usual has articulated the conundrum crystal clear.

...An aging Europe urgently needs more immigrants     NO !This kind of thinking is exactly why EU should be dissolved, and as soon as possible.  European countries do not need more immigrants, but real policies supporting families and children.And this is something EU, based on 19. century economical model of mercantelism and failed neoliberalism is not capable of.Neoliberalism in Europe is causing silent economic genocide of nations, and only return of national states where governments are responsible to its citizens can solve it.Support of family values and children seems to be totaly unknown to Joschka Fischer. Lets Europe die, let the barbarians take over - is this the German receipe for European future ?We could do different:http://www.genomofcapitalism.com/index.php/17-ways-of-productivity-subvencing-instead-of-outsourcing-2

Perhaps it is time to consider a serious attempt at resolution:  why not offer euro zone countries several "euro currencies" with constituent nations choosing which to use.  This would offer scope for orderly devaluation within a controlled central system.  Over time as economies harmonized the number of currencies would reduce fairly painlessly.  But EU institutions could supervise the multiple currencies and still coordinate borrowing.  This concept would require a fair bit of detailed planning but would leave the EU in control of developments.  The current approach guarantees the failure of the whole project.

Hi Joschka,Not every country can be Germany.It's not the other countries that need to remember this, it's Germany that needs to remember it.Not every EU nation can accomplish all that the Germans have accomplished, even in the past 10 years.No matter how hard Germany tries, the other EU partners are never going to BE Germany.So, some accommodation must be made.For starters, trying to cap budget deficits at only 3% of GDP may be slam-dunk for Germany, but not for other EU member nation states.Maybe one day that could be done. But for now, let's grant some room to those that can't make the cut (pun intended). Henceforth, set the deficit-to-GDP at 4% for all EU nations until 2020 and move on.That should take care of France's deficit problems for the foreseeable and assist the other high deficit nations.Germany especially can influence the outcome of the Greek election, by speaking softly now, prior to the vote. By appearing willing to work around Greek economic problems through dialogue, instead of through confrontation, Gemany will again look like Greece's ever-patient mother giving the boy yet another gentle reminder. Doing so now, before the election, will steal the thunder from the anti-austerity parties/voters.To placate Italy, a generous share (but not more than half) of the Jean-Claude Juncker 15 billion euro investment seed money, should go to towns and cities in northern Italy, for the express purpose of job creation.When jobs are created, especially when focused within a small region like northern Italy, the government collects more tax revenue, more outside investment filters in, and both micro and macro economies begin to improve.If Italy then seems cooperative, then it would be appropriate to reward the mild response with additional economic assistance to spur the Italian economy or temporarily ease deficit and debt requirements.By driving the solutions, instead of being driven to them, the EU will remain and with the noted temporary adjustments, eventually reach the laudable goals promoted by the ECB, the EU leadership, by banks and credit rating agencies.As always, very best regards, JBShttp://johnbrianshannon.com
