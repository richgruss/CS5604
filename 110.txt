EXCLUSIVE: Six Tory MPs to defect to Ukip if it wins Rochester and Strood by-election
UP to half a dozen Tory MPs are ­planning to defect to Ukip if their party loses Thursday’s by-election.

REXFarage is upbeat more Tory MPs will cross the party line before the general electionInsiders claim Basildon and Billericay MP John Baron is the most likely to cross the floor.Five others could also make the switch in the coming weeks, according to sources. Last night Mr Baron refused to rule out joining Ukip and would refer only to earlier comments he made on BBC’s Newsnight last month.When he was asked on the programme whether he would defect, he replied: “You should never say never in politics.” However, he added: “My very strong preference is to stay within the Conservative Party.”Ukip is on course for victory in the Kent constituency of Rochester and Strood on Thursday. One opinion poll gave the party a 12-point lead.Last night Mark Reckless, the former Tory MP who sparked the by-election by defecting to Ukip, told the Sunday Express that victory could result in a realignment of British politics of the sort not witnessed since the collapse of the Liberal Party in 1922.He said: “I don’t know what the result will be next Thursday and obviously I will be fighting for every vote but if Ukip can win here then Ukip can win across the country.“I don’t know whether it is an earthquake or a tsunami but we are seeing the potential realignment of our political system and it is conceivable that, as the political system changed in the 1920s with Labour replacing the Liberals, we may see a similar change over the next decade.”GETTYJohn Baron is seen as the most likely defector



            We are getting almost the same degree  of support from former Labour and Tory voters        
Mark Reckless


Mr Reckless said that Ukip is now able to attract the same level of support from Labour as it does from the Tories, echoing the findings of last week’s opinion poll which found that 40 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 were now backing Ukip.He said: “We are getting almost the same degree of support from ex-Labour voters as we are from ex-Conservative voters but at least as striking is the ­support from people who did not vote in the last general election and who have not voted for a generation.“I am getting support from a number of new voters who have never voted before who are in their 70s.“I have had two people find me on Twitter, one lady who said she will never vote for anyone unless she knows them and she has got to know me and will support me, and another who said he never thought there was any point in voting until he saw what Ukip were ­saying as the agents of change and to break up the cosy cartel the other ­parties have had for too long.“There are many Labour voters who would never have considered voting for me because I was a Tory. Now I am Ukip they are willing to vote for me to rep­resent them.“The Tory label was holding me back. I feel now I have been set free.”Ukip’s first MP Douglas Carswell, who won last month’s Clacton by-election, said he saw first-hand the support for Ukip among former Labour supporters as he joined Mr Reckless on the campaign trail last week.He said: “I was in a traditional Labour ward and what really struck me and was reminiscent of my Clacton experience was that people that I just wouldn’t have even considered worth talking to to try and get them to vote for me are now willing to vote because the old party grounds are so contaminated in the eyes of the voters.“In that traditional Labour ward there were a huge number of ex-Labour voters, who never in a million years would vote Conservative and who have given up on Labour, will now vote for Ukip.“At times it took a while for me to walk down the street because there were so many people ­coming up to me.“If things go the way I hope they will in Rochester on Thursday, then I think it is further evidence that Ukip are the first party in generations that have sussed out how to unlock the first-past-the-post system. The implications of that are huge.“Clacton was seen as a very Ukip-friendly seat. Political gurus have looked at the numbers and have said Rochester is the 270th most Ukip- friendly seat. If we can do what the polls suggest we might do next Thursday, there are 269 other seats upstream of that which could be unlocked too.“That is the potential, although nothing in life is ever certain.”Despite Labour being under threat from Ukip, they have turned their big guns on David Cameron, accusing him of resorting to “desperate measures” to defeat Ukip at the by-election.Rochester and Strood’s Labour Party candidate Naushabah Khan made the claim in response to last week’s appeal by the Prime Minister to supporters of Ed Miliband to vote Tory to keep out Ukip.In a highly unusual move, Mr Cameron urged Labour, Liberal Democrat and even Green supporters to give their votes to the Tory candidate Kelly ­Tolhurst to prevent a “Ukip boost and all the uncertainty and instability that leads to”.His demand followed an opinion poll commissioned by the former Tory party treasurer Lord Ashcroft, which put Ukip on 44 per cent, the Conservatives on 32, Labour on 17 and the Lib Dems on only two per cent. Ms Khan told the Sunday Express: “Cameron is increasingly resorting to desperate measures to try and pull in Conservative support.“For us it is about getting people to go out there and vote with their heart and vote for what they believe in and in this election we think the only party that is talking about the real issues is Labour.“I think there is an element of frustration with what this Government has done and people want to express that frustration and they are fed up.“For some of them voting Ukip might be a way for them to do that but actually, when we are out knocking on doors, we are finding our support is still there and there are a lot of people who do want to support us.”
