Why I'm charged with election fraud -- Please attend my trial on Monday Oct. 27 8:30am Berrien County Courthouse, MI





(Trial time has been corrected above - 8:30, not 10am)




"With absolutely no evidence, I was charged with voter fraud and bound over for trial."





The USA proclaims itself the "land of freedom," but the reality is we live under the world's

most corrupt legal system.  It has rigged courts, bribed judges, phony trials, extortion by 

lawyers, and over two million prisoners.  More prisoners than any other country, in real numbers and proportionately.



You can be sent to prison and even put to death with absolutely no evidence. The truth is

hidden by America's corporate owned media, and by Berrien County media. They are afraid to tell the truth about Michigan's Emergency Manager system where rule is without the consent of the governed.



Benton Harbor now has four Emergency Managers. They are called a Transitional Team.  Appointed by the governor, they are direct representatives of the corporate giant, Whirlpool, that runs Benton Harbor. This team can overrule decisions made by the democratically elected city council. They can sell off public assets to private interests. The team includes two former Whirlpool employees, one county treasurer, and a member of the State Treasury Department. This is what fascism in Michigan looks like-the merger of government with private corporations.



Within this dictatorial political environment, the Benton Harbor community exercised their democratic right to recall the Whirlpool-allied mayor.  With absolutely no evidence, I was charged with voter fraud and bound over for trial.



This attack was intended to stop the community's recall election from going forward. In a hearing to determine if there was evidence to take me to trial, Mark Goff, a forensic document examiner with the Michigan State Police testified that changes to the election petitions were made with different ink, but he could not determine who made the changes, when they were made, or whether the person who signed the petition changed it.



His testimony provided no evidence against me, however Judge Sterling Schrock, Judge Charlie LaSata  and Prosecutor Mike Sepic all stated that you do not need evidence  to go to trial in Michigan. The government is counting on an all-white jury, that may be motivated by something other than the truth, to convict me.



Soon after, in a momentary victory for the people, Judge John DeWane ruled that the contested mayoral recall election should be placed on the November ballot -- upon the first Amendment's political core Freedom of Speech. The issue boiled down to admitting 21 duplicate signatures that had been invalidated based upon faulty practice by the Berrien County Clerk's Office.



Attorney John LaPietra stated that the Berrien County clerk, armed with $20,000.00 in funding from the County Board, appealed (that ruling) with support from two major law firms and the Attorney Generals office, representing the Secretary of State and the Board of Elections. 



The court of Appeals reversed Judge John DeWane's favorable ruling, and it was essentially upheld by the state's Supreme Court. This scenario once again shows the unity

of government and corporations.



Democracy has been stolen from the people. Water rights have been stolen. Poverty is growing. We the people have nothing in common with the billionaire's, their corporations, and their government. We must stand together.  



Nobody in the world has ever gotten anything by appealing to the moral sense of the people who were oppressing them.  We must stand together and fight back.

Rev. Edward Pinkney - How BANCO Started:

"Many years ago I was going about my life believing that the justice system was just that until I started going to the court house to observe all the wrong convictions. There are numerous factors for wrongful convictions in the Berrien County court system. Most of the problems are in the local judicial system." "It's hard to believe that in the year 2012 we have a county in Michigan with a legal system this antiquated and racist. What's harder to believe is that no one at the State or National level is taking any action to remedy the situation." "We cannot run society for the privileged and allow a significant proportion of the population to be marginalized. It impacts the quality of life for all of us. If we have throwaway people, a justice system which tolerates injustice is doomed to collapse. I am truly ready for action."
