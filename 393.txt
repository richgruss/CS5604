About Support and Privacy








What is “Supporting”?   
                        Supporting a Thunderclap campaign is like signing a petition but with the added power of simultaneously sharing a message. You and every other supporter are standing up for an idea with the power of your voice.
                    








How do I support?   
                        Choose between your Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr account to grant Thunderclap permission to post a message on your behalf. That’s it! If the campaign reaches its support goal before the deadline, Thunderclap will automatically post your message along with everyone else who has supported.
                    








A note on privacy   
                        When you log into Thunderclap using your Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr account, you’re allowing our platform to share a single message on your behalf. That’s all. We use the absolute minimum permissions possible to post a message on your behalf. The platforms we integrate with sometimes include additional permissions that we do not use and we will not post anything from your friends' accounts.
