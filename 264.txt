Stop Lying; We Demanded N3tn, Not N130bn, ASUU Tells FG

Nasir Fagge

The National President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr. Nasir Fagge, has accused the federal government of not telling Nigerians the truth about the demand of the union as regards the government’s statement that the union’s demand has been met.
Fagge said ASUU had a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with the federal government for it to spend over N3 trillion to turn around the fortune of all federal and state universities and also to better the lot of the educational sector in the country.
“The agreement is for the federal government to spend N800 billion yearly for the next four years, but what we have is government talking about N130 billion which is very insignificant,” he said.
Speaking, Tuesday, while fielding questions from journalists at the end of the congress of the Benue State University chapter of ASUU, in Makurdi, Fagge said: “Our demands are genuine, and it is based on the mutual agreement entered into in 2009 by government and ASUU. We urge the government to be responsible to that agreement.
“President Goodluck Jonathan said the strike is being politicised but the truth is that it is government that is playing politics with our demands. It is as if every problem in this country is now being politicised.
“I want to ask one basic question: Is it political to ask government to be responsible enough to implement an agreement she willingly entered into.
“It is important to state clearly that we are a union of intellectuals, and we cannot accept a situation were the tail will wag the dog. Whatever we do is for the betterment of the Nigerian university system,” Fagge said.
The ASUU national president also said: “It is important to place on record that the struggle is a continuous one but the implementation of the 2009 agreement is key to improving on facilities in our universities and placing it at par with what we have in other parts of the world.”

How to write the perfect investment proposal


Image

StickyOctober 2, 2013 Ibeh Genius
Leave a comment




As an established Investment network, we have been responsible for reviewing literally thousands of investment proposals and one of the repeating themes that we have been asked over and over is to explain the methods that can be employed to create the perfect investment proposal or investment summary that is almost guaranteed to get the attention of Business angel investors 
The type of investment proposal that will GRAB a business angel Investor’s interest and have him/her almost demanding to discuss the investment pitch further! Over the years I have seen this occur many times on Venture Giant, and I have seen seemingly weak value propositions receive 9 – 10 angel investor contacts on the day of despatch only because the investment proposal had been well written and well thought out!
Is it possible, and can it be learned? I believe that it can be – and this article hopes to explore some of the crucial elements that you should think about whilst crafting your perfect investment pitch. I have also taken the liberty of enclosing a sample investment summary that I am sure will be of great benefit to entrepreneurs looking to create their own investment proposals but not knowing how to apply some of the points that I will talk about below.
My main aim with Venture Giant was not only to create a portal that can get entrepreneurs connected with Angel Investors so as to raise the necessary angel funding that they require but to also create more and more resources of useful, actionable articles that can assist entrepreneurs actively to become ‘investment-ready’ – and this to all in a very reasonably priced environment. From the feedback we are receiving I am now starting to see more and more entrepreneurs benefiting from the knowledge and experience that is featured in our News Channel. At the very least (according to one of the emails I received recently) entrepreneurs are now demanding more from Angel investors and citing the correct investment terms when doing so, and this is very encouraging.
As Venture Giant is primarily an angel Investment deal flow service for angel investors, high net worth individuals and angel syndicates our main aim has always been to send out the most attractive investment opportunities to our investors that read well, make sense, and ARE investable. 
Ultimately, if the investment proposals we send out to our Investors on Venture Giant are not up to this standard then we are at a risk of losing active angel investors that sign up to use our service. 
It is in my interest to ensure that our entrepreneurs’ submit investment proposals that are of a certain calibre and meet our guidelines of service. 
So, the main purpose of this article is to concentrate on how to create the perfect investment opportunity that can be used to submit onto Venture Giant, or for that matter – on any other investment network.
Six points on the perfect investment pitch: 
1. The first point I would like to address is that regardless of what you are seeing in the press and in the media about the recession and shrinking GDP data – there will always be money out there for businesses that can MAKE money. Always was there, and will always be there. So your investment proposal must always be geared towards this important point. So make your proposal sound like it can actually make money by creating a convincing proposition.
2. Second point to consider when describing your product is to KEEP IT SIMPLE! I have seen it to many times and it is deeply disappointing for me – an entrepreneur submits a really good opportunity to our angel Investors, but it turns out to be too darn complicated!
Yes agreed, it is important to show to a potential angel investor that you know your stuff – but keep your investment proposal simple. 
When investors look through your investment summary they are going to scan through it – and using jargon rich words like CMS, CRM will inevitably confuse and put-off most Angel Investors and move them away from your value proposition! Ignore this advice at your own peril – Use simple words like Software – not a CRM solution! Online media/advertising instead of PPC campaigns etc.
3. Another major point that I have seen entrepreneurs overlook is what Industry sector their business is in! Let me give you an example: 
‘What industry sector is google in?’ 
Think about it for one second: Immediate responses will inevitably always be: Computer, Software, but NO. It’s Advertising! Why? Because 96% of Google’s revenue comes from advertising! So as an industry sector, you would choose Internet, and Advertising. You do not want to lose potential investors because you chose Computers or Software instead of Advertising or Media!
4. Don’t be shy! Talk about your Funding Requirements with no shame! How do you wish to use the money that you raise? What will you purchase – and why is it needed? These are all very valuable questions, and they must be addressed in your investment proposal. 
5. Include your background/experience information ONLY if it is relevant to your business or investment proposal. Do you have complementary skills that will assist you in running your business and turning it into a success? If so, talk about this. If not, does your management team have the necessary skills? Talk about this! If not, then skip it for now!
6. Scalability! Does your business have global appeal? Make sure you include this if it does! Facebook, Google are scalable globally. 
If you would like further in-depth analysis of any of the terms listed above, we have written entire articles about each aspect of your investment proposal and this can all be located in Venture Giant’s News channel. 
How to write the perfect Investment Summary
on Venture Giant for submission to Angel investors
Venture Giant is NOT an ‘unmoderated forum’. All investment proposals are checked by us, and we do not approve all investment proposals. 
TO maintain a fair and equitable environment please always ensure that you do not mention your company name or supply any types of contact details in your investment proposal that you submit on Venture Giant. So instead of using your company name use a generic term, like “our Aeronautics Company” or “Media Trading Platform”. Alternatively use expressions like: “Our Limited Company,” or “We”, “Us”, “I”
An investment proposal by a company called “Media Deals” is attached below and through our assistance received a lot of attention on Venture Giant. 
Please review it – and though it may not be related to what your industry and/or business, this sample investment proposal will at the very least give you an idea of the quality of investment proposals that we send out to our registered investors.
 
1. Investment Title Guidelines:
The investment title of your proposal must explain what your business does. So create a compelling enough title that will position your business to be understood instantly in the investor’s mind before he/she has even read your investment proposal! Consider also that the Subject line of the email that is sent out to our registered angel Investors will include your Investment title. A simple, catchy, snappy title will ensure that an investor will open his email and read your entire investment proposal that he receives through Venture Giant. A good title will also ensure that any other investors browsing through our angel investment network will be compelled to read more!
 
Sample investment Title: (25 Characters)
Media Trading Platform 
 
2. Investment Summary Guidelines:
This is the public part of your proposal and this must compel an investor to want to read the ENTIRE investment description. 
Ideas to mention here are:
Why your investment opportunity is attractive!
How much money is needed, and how will it be used?
What will be the return on investment (ROI) for an Angel Investor and when will they see this return?
Ideally you should aim to write this paragraph AFTER you have created and drafted your entire investment pitch below, so as to ensure that you do not miss out any important facts!
 
Sample Investment Summary: (500 Characters)
We have created a state of the art UK media trading system that offers Print-media-buyers and ad-sellers (newspapers, magazines and publications) the opportunity of accessing real-time print ad inventory for which agencies and/or advertisers can either buy or bid for. We are seeking a £50k angel investment to be used for Working Capital and Online Marketing. Based on our projections, Angel Investors will see a ROI in year 2 of 34%!
3. Investment Description Guidelines:
Your Investment description that you create on Venture Giant will have to answer the question:
“What’s in it for the Angel Investor!” – I have seen it to many times! Entrepreneurs talk and talk about their product and business…. And then that is it! Strike a balance, and talk about your business, how you will make money, why you are seeking investment and how an investor will make a return!
This is your investment pitch – and don’t forget to add some Industry Statistics! A simple search on Google will reveal some interesting facts that you can include in your investment proposal.
 
Venture Giant Insider Edge:
Your investment Description is essentially your pitch (or elevator pitch). 
 Address key issues like:
What makes your investment proposal an attractive investment opportunity?
How much money is needed, and how will it be used?
What will be the return on investment (ROI) for an Angel Investor and when will they see this return?
This can be effective as a teaser to attract the initial attention of an angel investor particularly when using email or an online angel investment matching service.
Sample Investment Description:
(3000 Characters)
 
Our Online Media trading system has been in development for the past 12 months. It offers Print-media-buyers and sellers the opportunity of accessing real-time print ad inventory for which agencies and/or advertisers can either buy or bid for.
 
Publishers always have excess adverts to sell at discounted rates before their 7PM print deadline (the “deadline discount” game) and there is a great demand for this ad-space as it is usually heavily discounted. But in the UK there is no way of accessing these heavily discounted ads. The only real way is to create relationships with magazines, and/or, call each publication and ask them for a ‘deadline discount’.
 
Our online eBay type bidding system aims to solve this problem by enabling magazines, newspapers and other publications to advertise their ‘deadline discount adverts’ to people wishing to purchase these adverts. All discounted advertising space is automatically categorised by magazine type, ad-size and cost.
 
Purchasing an ad on our online trading system involves a user simply “adding the advert” to their shopping basket and paying for it via a credit or debit card.
 
We expect to generate revenues from these purchases of between 6% and 8% on all transactions. It is FREE for Media publishers (magazines and newspapers) to upload their advert availability.
This trading platform can be scaled globally, and my longer term plans is to licence the platform to individuals on a country to country basis. Apart from the upfront and ongoing revenues, further commercialisation could come from INTERCONNECTING the databases together from each country. So, a UK based customer who was looking to buy advertising space could also browse advertising opportunities in India (for example) and if that customer from the UK system subsequently chose to purchase an advert in a different country, we could automate and revenue share between licensees. The commercialisation possibilities are endless.
 
The Industry
It is often stated that ‘offline media (magazines and newspapers) is in serious trouble’. However all the real-data points to the contrary. According the media handbook 2007, it is estimated that the value of consumer magazines are £7.2bn and the business media industry – including magazines are valued at £18bn to £20bn.
 
Magazines themselves – the printed ones – have continued to flourish in the last decade since the launch of the Internet. At least one new title is launched every day of the year and has resulted in rising total volumes of sales and of consumer expenditure on printed products.
 
The Advertising Association (AA) predicts a 15.6 per cent increase in consumer magazine ad-spend over the next 12 years, taking overall advertising investment in the industry from £750m in 2006 to £889m in 2018, which is a view shared by the UK’s leading advertiser, Procter & Gamble, who have increased their investment in print by 10.7 per cent over the last two years.
In Summary
We believe that our online service could do amazingly well in the fight against online advertising as advertisers identify how effectively magazine advertising can build customer loyalty. Our online service has now been created and is all set to launch.
I have had 10 years experience in the publishing business, and I have worked with Random House and learned their marketing methods. I have seen this gap in the market, and I believe an online media trading system is much needed. Using my skills, and experience in this space, I believe that I can turn this business into a great success and commercialise this media trading platform to generate sustainable turnover and profitability.
This Media Trading System is a Win/Win business solution for print media. Advertisers will get discounted ad-space and publishers of magazine will get to move inventory in a much easier, faster and streamlined way.
Please contact me to discuss this investment proposal further.
Venture Giant Insider Edge:
Always try to end with something that the investor should do. 
So use expressions like:
We have a full business plan available on request. We are very passionate about our business and we would invite any interested angel investors to contact us now to discuss this investment proposal further with us now.
Always make it easy for Angel Investors to understand your business and investment proposal. Talk about your background and business, and then talk about your product! Yes you have the scientific knowledge on the chemical composition of Biodiesel, but an angel won’t so keep it simple!
Pearl – As an entrepreneur you must learn to demonstrate that you can make Angel Investor money! Convince investors that read your investment proposal that your business opportunity is sustainable and that you are the man (or lady) for the job! This is so important! Your investment summary should demonstrate how you are going to translate an Angel Investor’s investment into profit for them.
Thank you for taking the time to read this brief outline, and I hope that it helps you to create a compelling enough story that will get you the Angel Investor interest – whether it be through MGN,Venture Giant, or otherwise!
The investment proposal listed above is based upon an online web based service. Please follow this link if you are a Property Developer looking for Property Funding and would like to view a Property development funding investment template.

FG To Pocket N1.33trn From Sale Of PHCN

Leave a comment




The Federal Government will earn about $8.3 billion (N1.328 trillion) from the sale of the unbundled power generation and distribution companies of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria, PHCN, according to the National Council on Privatisation, NCP.
Part of the money, according to NCP, will also be derived from the sale of the 10 new power plants being built by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited, NDPHC.
Speaking at a special forum on, “Financing the Power Sector Reforms for Economic Development,” organised by the Bankers’ Committee in Abuja, Chairman, Technical Committee of the NCP, Mr. Atedo Peterside, said the new owners of the PHCN assets are expected to invest about N300 billion in Nigeria for the provision of 6.52 million electricity meters and other capital expenditures.
“For the Discos, some very significant investments will also be required to improve efficiencies and reduce Aggregate, Technical Commercial and Collection Losses. Based on the proposals submitted by the core investors, new meters will be installed over the course of the next five years as follows:-
“At an estimated weighted average cost (purchase and installation) of N25, 000 per meter, this amounts to over N150bn. “The bulk of this should be recoverable from the consumer, but then the distribution infrastructure also needs to be modernised and expanded to achieve greater coverage. The 11 Discos are projecting annual capital expenditures in the region of N60 billion per annum for each of the next five years,” Peterside said.
He added that a grand total of approximately $3.3bn (N528 billion) should accrue to the Federal Government’s coffers from the PHCN Genco and Disco transactions.
He further stated that at a crude estimate of $1.2 million per mega watt, the sale of the Federal Government’s 80 per cent equity stake to core investors will raise close to $5 billion (N800 billion), expressing optimism that about 70 per cent of the amount will be financed in 2014 largely through debt/loan instruments provided by Nigerian banks.
Peterside disclosed that the new owners of the power generating and distribution companies will need to make investments of about $4.28 billion (N684.8 billion) to boost the country’s power supply by an additional 4,284.4 mega watts.
“The nine PHCN Gencos, including Omotosho and Olorunsogo, only had available capacity of 2,692 MW as at 10th Sept. 2013, as against a total installed capacity of 6,976.40 MW.
“Financing the necessary capital expenditure (capex) to fund this incremental 4,284.4 MW that is required to achieve full capacity, crudely estimated at $1m per MW approximately, will cost an additional $4.28bn.” he said.
He conceded that there are still some unfinished businesses in the privatisation of the assets of the PHCN, calling for concerted efforts to ensure the success of the exercise.
He said, “I must emphasis that there is still some “unfinished business” with the privatisation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Successor Companies and so, like accomplished sportsmen, I believe we must stay focused and not take our eyes off the ball until the game is truly over.
“However, it is pertinent to remember that this is really the beginning of a journey and not the end of a journey as some have mistaken it to be. As we all know, the purpose of privatising the Discos and Gencos was not just to transfer ownership of the assets. The primary purpose was to bring into play new owners with deep pockets who could finance and/or access financing for the rapid restoration of lost capacity and/or add significant new capacity to make up for decades of Government neglect and mismanagement.”
Continuing, Peterside said, “In my opinion, FGN should also continue to offer a safety net by subsidising the tariffs for the poorest consumers, that is, the R1 and R2 customers. [Vanguard]

Jim Iyke’s Deliverance: the Actor Debunks News Reports in a New Statement

Leave a comment




Nollywood ‘bad boy’ actor, Jim iyke has cried out to debunk news report going viral on the Internet that he was delivered from witchcraft at the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) headed by Prophet TB Joshua.
The actor was said to have undergone deliverance recently, Sunday, at the church and was reportedly freed from some evil spirits which have allegedly prevented him from finding a wife despite being qualified to have one.
Some had also reported that he was delivered from witchcraft, but the talented make-believe star has rebuffed such reports by laughing it out.
He reacted to such reports via his Twitter handle when he wrote,
“lol witchcraft?! It’s imperative I underscore that people are oblivious to what transpired [during my deliverance]. Ignorance is no excuse. Tailor your opinion to who you know.”
Meanwhile, reactions have continued to trail the incident. Some Nigerians have questioned the authenticity of the video which showed the deliverance of Jim Iyke. 
Others termed it as another form of ‘acting’ by the actor allegedly planned with the church for publicity purpose.

Things To Love About Being Single


Image

StickyOctober 2, 2013 Ibeh Genius
Leave a comment




A great deal of the cultural dialogue about  being single or unmarried is focused on the negative aspects of being single or on how to find someone to marry.
 There are negatives to being single. However, I am also told that there are negatives to being married. Yet, we are not bombarded with articles and opinions about how married people should work hard on getting divorced. OK, that is extreme, but you do see my point, right?
There are people who are single because they do not want to be married, but most of us, including those who are divorced or widowed, are single because our personal and professional choices have not aligned to produce a (or another) marriage-worthy relationship. I told someone recently who was attempting to fix me up that I’d prefer they leave it alone. 
Why, you say? Shouldn’t I take all the help I can get? No. In my short life I have learned two things about myself and life as it relates to dating:
 (1) Blind dates and fix-ups are usually only good for the purpose of collecting entertaining war stories and 
(2) God will do what God will do and he’ll tell me about it when I need to know about it.
So, what do we do while we are waiting for our choices to align or God to do his part? We enjoy the good things about being single.
Here are my five favorite things about being single…
1. Freedom
“I’m single because I was born that way.” – Mae West
This is the big one. I have asked married friends and family and the consensus is that the thing they miss most about being single is freedom. As one friend put it, I miss “being able to make any decision without consulting or compromising on anything from paint colors, to car buying, to vacationing.” As a single person, I am free from the obligation to consult the schedules, opinions, feelings, needs and desires of another. I am also free from the responsibilities that come with family and marriage, which are many. I don’t have to worry about the financial stability, safety or the personal and professional future of another person. I can buy what I want, eat at whatever fancy restaurant I please, travel to places that interest me and live a lifestyle that supports my interests. Single people can do whatever they want. Living as independent single people — not reliant on family or a partner — is the only time in our lives when we will have almost total control over our lives and be really free.
2. Self-Awareness
“I don’t like to be labeled as lonely just because I am alone.” -Delta Burke
One of my favorite things about being single has been getting to know who I am, Getting to know ourselves is a great opportunity. I know that sounds corny and everyone says it, but think about it carefully. While it is true that we can create ourselves into what we want to be — we can become a doctor or parent or school teacher or circus animal trainer — that is not the same as getting to know who we really are deep down inside. Being a single adult provides the opportunity to explore who we are, what we like, what we value, what we require to be happy and, sometimes more importantly, what we do not want in life and in relationships. This kind of self-exploration is difficult when you are in a relationship or married. 
In relationships, much time is focused on figuring out the relationship and getting to know or meeting the needs of your partner. Knowing who we really are ensures that we don’t lose ourselves in a relationship and it makes dating and finding a partner much easier — you know in advance what you
want and need and the areas in which you are willing to compromise.
It is also a lot easier to “just be yourself” if you know that person.
3. Simplicity
“I like being single, I’m always there when I need me.” – Art Leo
Being single can be easy — if you let it. Relationships, no matter how good, are complicated. Anytime two people are in close quarters, there will be conflict and compromises. Single people almost always, in almost every decision, have the option to take the path of least resistance; in relationships, that option doesn’t come as often.
 A single person’s decisions involve only themselves and who they choose to involve; in a relationship, all decisions have the potential for conflict and complication.
I only have to consider my family at holidays and special occasions. 
At my house, there are no arguments about the thermostat, how fast the dishes get washed, whether to get cable or pay someone to mow the lawn or how the house is decorated. I love my 1,600 square-foot house. It is just what I need: It is small and simple. I only have to buy for one person. That’s one car, TV, computer, cellphone, plane ticket… you get the idea. Singleness also provides flexibility; I can accommodate change (like moving, accepting a new job offer or taking a last-minute trip) much more easily than someone who is in a relationship. While there are plenty of things that can complicate life in general, being single is less complicated than being in a relationship.
4. Selfishness
“The only reason to get married is if you want children.” – Alice Tate
I do not like being around selfish people. It is one of the hardest things for me to do. I am talking about those folks who can only talk about themselves, are stingy with money or think we are all here to serve them. So, I am not suggesting that single people act like jerks. No.
Here, I am talking about the ability to focus on areas of your life that would get less attention if you were in a relationship or married. Being single allows you to focus (selfishly) on your career, rather than balance your career time with the career and personal needs of someone else. If you are ambitious, then being single will treat you well. You can work long hours, do all the professional development you can stand and spend your evenings reading all those books on leadership. 
(Note: this kind of selfishness improves your ability to be a solid and contributing partner in a future relationship or marriage, if that is your aim.) As a single person, you can selfishly pursue your own hobbies, interests and relationships with friends and family without the necessity to balance your time between your partner’s hobbies, friends and family. I can take an entire Saturday morning to write without the need to worry about someone else’s schedule, I can have friends or family over whenever I please or I can play the guitar while watching Netflix (this requires the volume on the TV to be at about 45) all evening. Singleness permits you to be selfish in good ways.
5. Service
“Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.” (1 Corinthians 7:8, NIV)
The Apostle Paul also told the men that he’d prefer them to be unmarried as well. Why? Because they would be free spend their time in prayer and service to God. Being single gives you more time to be of service to others, whether it is your church, a community service organization or your favorite non-profit. Singleness allows you to be unselfish with your free time and resources. Once you have determined what you value and what you want to support, you can commit to volunteerism and philanthropy without the need to consult with someone else. 
Time and money are powerful tools in helping others, but money is often a huge point of contention for many couples. As a single person, you are in control of how your money and time is put to use. Service is a great way to help others, feel good about you, and make friends.
Clearly, this is not an exhaustive list. There are many good things about singleness wrapped up in these five areas. In fact, I chose not to list all the good things individually because there are far too many. This is why I think the discussion of being single needs a new perspective.
 Being single is not worse than being married; in many cases, it is better, but, at the very least, it is just different.
I hope one day to bump into the marriage-worthy fellow that God has for me, but until that time, I am going to enjoy my life. Being single is a good thing.

If you want to lose weight, you’re not alone. Almost half of all Americans are trying to lose weight at any given time. While there are many things you can do to shed pounds, losing weight too quickly can be dangerous. Fad diets, diet pills, and fasting may help you reduce the number on the scale, but these methods can cause severe health complications.

Fad Diets
The purpose of most fad diets is to promote rapid weight loss that you can see almost overnight. Fad diets are short-term solutions; if you stay on a fad diet for more than a few days, you could cause your body serious harm. You should always consult your healthcare provider before beginning any kind of weight loss program to make sure your body can take the added strain to its system. Here are some popular fad diets with simple instructions that claim to result in fast, short-term weight loss.
1.1
The Water Diet[2].
 This diet involves drinking a daily total of about 64 fluid ounces (8 cups) of cold (preferably refrigerated) water, at regular intervals.
Drink a glass of water before each meal and before each snack to suppress your appetite by making you feel fuller.
Do not add sweeteners or flavorings to your water.
Do not replace meals with water.
Take a daily multivitamin to replenish the nutrients lost through more frequent urination.
2.2
Juice Detox Diet, Juice Fast, or Hollywood Diet[3]. Although there are many variations on a juice detoxification fast or crash diet, they generally last for one to three days.
You can only drink fruit and vegetable juices on this type of fad diet.
Some variations of this diet involve taking vitamins or nutrients along with the juices, while others let you have a single meal per day.
The juices are meant to help your body flush out toxins and eliminate several pounds of (mostly) water weight from your system.[4]
3.3
The Master Cleanse, Maple Syrup Diet, or Lemonade Diet[5]. This fad diet is a liquid-only diet.
Drink between 6 to 12 glasses of a special mixture of lemonade, cayenne pepper, water, and maple syrup each day.
You will also drink a cup of herbal laxative tea twice a day.
There is an optional period of easing into this fad diet, as well as an easing-out process.
It should only be done for very short-term weight loss and is supposed to function as a detoxifying cleanse rather than a strict weight-loss routine.
There is also an optional salt-water flush that can be incorporated into this diet.
4.4
The Cabbage Soup Diet[6]. This diet claims it can help you lose up to 10 pounds in one week.
It involves eating a low-fat, high fiber diet.
You mainly eat a special type of cabbage soup, but you can also have moderate portions of certain fruits and vegetables, occasional meats and rice, a minimum of 4 glasses of water and a multivitamin each day.
This diet lasts 7 days and is not recommended as a permanent solution for long-term weight loss because of the lack of nutrients you consume on it.
5.5
The Salt-Free Diet[7]. This diet helps you lose water weight by eliminating water retention in the body.
On this diet, you cannot have any salt, which includes not only table salt, but also all the added sodium found in pre-packaged and prepared foods.
This involves preparing sodium-free products at home or avoiding processed foods all together, which also means avoiding to eat out at restaurants.
It also involves drinking up to 2 liters (about 8 cups) of water each day to replenish essential bodily fluids, although green tea is also allowed in moderation.
Many prepared foods have as much as 30% of your daily value. You get your daily requirement of sodium from a healthy diet; too much can cause you toretain water weight.
Because some dietary salt is essential for good health, the Salt-Free Diet should not be followed for more than one to two weeks.
It’s important to note that this diet is more effective for those people who tend to retain water more easily than others. If you’re not sure whether you’re particularly prone to water retention, pay attention to your hands and feet the next time you eat something salty. If your rings are more difficult to take off, or your shoes become tighter after a salty meal, those are signs that your body is sensitive to sodium.
6.6
The HCG Diet[8].
This diet combines injections or supplements of HCG (human chorionic gonaotropin) with a severely restricted calorie intake.
The calorie restriction alone (only 500 to 800 calories per day) is enough to promote weight loss in most people; it is significantly under the recommended daily calorie allowance, even for people attempting to lose weight.
HCG is not monitored by the FDA, and can have unpleasant side effects in many people.
Those who follow this diet typically gain the weight back immediately after stopping it.
Weight Loss Spa Treatments
Another easy way to get fast weight-loss results is to get beauty treatments specifically designed to help you shed inches quickly. By visiting a spa, sauna, or wellness clinic offering weight loss beauty services and procedures, you can have your pick of numerous beauty treatments and spa services that are designed to help you lose weight quickly or to alter your appearance by reducing bloating, tightening your skin, or removing body fluids.[9]These processes only involve temporary weight loss, but the results are immediate and do not involve dieting or 
Exercise.
1.1
Ask about a mineral body wrap. Some mineral wraps claim to help you slim down by literally making you “lose” inches off of your waist, thighs, and arms. The process involves a mineral-based cleanse that is supposed to detoxify your body, helping you shed weight, reduce cellulite (fat near the surface of your skin), and tone and firm your skin almost instantly.
2.2
Get a lipase body wrap. Lipase body wraps are another quick-slim beauty treatment that follow a two-step phase.
First, an enzyme wrap is applied to rid your body of fat tissue near the surface of the skin.
A second mineral wrap is then applied, designed to tighten and smooth your skin.
3.3
Get a European body wrap. European body wraps are another potential option for spa services aimed at dropping inches off of trouble spots. This procedure is supposed to firm and tone skin, reduce the appearance of cellulite or stretch marks, and temporarily promotes weight loss.
4.4
Get a hot body wrap. Heat-based body wraps are perhaps a more well-known spa treatment, designed both to detoxify your body and stimulate smooth, toned skin. The heat and massage involved in most heat or steam treatments is targeted at improving circulation and helping your body slim down quickly.
5.5
Go to a sauna. Saunas may result in a loss of a pint of sweat in just a quarter of an hour.
You should hydrate by drinking a few glasses of water after spending time in a sauna to reduce the risk of dehydration.
Keep in mind that time in saunas must be limited, preferably to no more than one 15- to 20-minute session per day.
People with blood pressure or heart problems should not use saunas, nor should young children.[10]
6.6
Get acolonic. Some spas offer colonic irrigation treatments, which involve physically flushing your colon with large amounts of water to remove fecal accumulation.
This process may help some people who suffer from bloating, gas, and constipation and claims to spur weight loss in some individuals.[11]
7.7
Liposuction can shed pounds instantly. Liposuction is a surgical option for fast, targeted weight loss, generally only recommended for people with one or two specific areas of highly fatty tissue but otherwise relatively healthy body weight.[12]
Because it is a surgical procedure, it carries significant health risks and should only be performed by a licensed professional.
Healthy Eating Habits
Change general nutrition and lifestyle habits. Adopting a number of simple but significant dietary and behavioral changes can be enough to jump-start weight loss for many people. Combining the suggestions below with your short-term diet plan will enhance your chances of reaching your weight-loss goals faster and maintaining those results in the long-term.
1.1
Develop a healthy and personalized meal plan.
Figure out how much you should be eating by scheduling a consultation with a dietitian or a physician to discuss your weight loss goals, special dietary needs, current eating habits, and potential areas for improvement.
Choose meals that have a healthy balance of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean proteins. A typical dinner plate should be filled with half vegetables or fruits, half whole grains and lean protein.
2.2
Plan your meals in advance.
This can help you incorporate more nutritious foods into your diet and limit your calorie intake.
3.3
Determine your daily calorie needs.
Your individual calorie needs will vary based on age, gender, height, and activity level. Knowing exactly how much your target daily intake is will help you stick to your diet.
Monitor the number of calories and grams of fat you consume each day and try not to exceed USDA guidelines.[13]
4.4
Keep a food diary.
Write down every meal, snack, and drink you consume as well as the approximate quantities for an entire week.
When possible, write down the number of calories in each food you eat as you eat it.
Keep in mind that the recommended serving size is often considerably smaller than the serving you actually eat.
Don’t forget to include coffee mix-ins, condiments, and other additions to your daily diet.
Once you have done this, you should be able to estimate your typical daily calorie intake and compare it to your goal with an online calorie calculator.
5.5
Identify your food triggers and plan accordingly.
Careful planning can help you avoid trigger foods and empty calorie traps you may have identified in your food journal. If you don’t purchase these foods or if you plan meals in advance, you will be less likely to sabotage your diet when pressed for time.
6.6
Watch your portion sizes.
Look for healthy, delicious meal and snack ideas online or in cookbooks, and create a menu for the week. Make a list of what you’ll need for these meals, and don’t stray from your list when you get to the grocery store. Looking at market circulars can also give you ideas and even cut costs by buying weekly sale items and seasonal produce.
Incorporate appropriate portion sizes into your meal plan. For instance, a healthy snack of almonds and dried cranberries can turn into a huge calorie source if you don’t pay attention to quantities. Also, preparing pre-apportioned healthy snacks can help you avoid mindless overeating and can make it convenient to grab a healthy snack.
7.7
Don’t skip meals. Eating a healthy breakfast increases your rest metabolic rate earlier in the day, keeps your energy levels high, and may help you resist the urge of high-calorie snacks throughout the day. Plan to eat a snack or meal every 2 to 4 hours to keep your metabolism active. Eating regularly also keeps your blood sugar stable and reduces unhealthy calorie binges or deviations from your meal plan.
8.8
Select smart substitutes for unhealthy sources of fat, sugar, and calories. Most foods have healthier counterparts that will allow you to enjoy your favorite foods without unnecessary fat, sugar, and calories. Exchanging high-calorie and high-fat foods and drinks for healthier alternatives can help youlose weightfaster.
9.9
Snack smartly.Swap potato chips and candy bars for snacks that are nutrient-rich and low in calories and fat. Avoid processed and packaged foods when possible, or buy snacks that have single-serving packets of 100 to 200 calories. Healthy and easy snacks include nuts, rice cakes, fresh or dried fruits, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, and so on. Vegetables are generally very low in calories, very high in fiber, and full of flavor and nutrition, but avoid fatty dressings or dips. Fruit provides a good source of soluble fiber, releasing energy more slowly and keeping you feeling full longer. Low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt or cheddar cheese, can also be healthy snacks in moderation. Try combining string cheese with a handful of grapes, spreading peanut butter on a few crackers, or dipping sliced red pepper into a few tablespoons of hummus.
10.10
Sip on low-calorie 100% fruit juice, seltzer, or water instead of soft drinks, energy drinks, flavored coffees, and martinis. Cutting calories with substitutions can be a lot easier than you might think. For example, a tall latte in the morning may pack 500 calories. Since a pound of body fat (lost or gained) is roughly equivalent to 3,500 calories, replacing that rich beverage with black coffee can help you lose a pound per week[14]. If you eat salad frequently, try substituting a low-fat vinaigrette for your ranch or blue cheese dressing[15]. Similarly, cook with a tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter, for instance, or opt for skim milk instead of whole.
11.11
Choose lean meats.Poultryandfishare naturally low in fat, and certain fish likesalmon, sardines, and fresh tuna are an excellent sources of antioxidants and Omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial to your health. Ask your butcher for lean cuts of beef or pork if you choose to buy them, and trim visible fat from meat before cooking. Consider eating vegetarian a few days each week. By replacing meat with nutritious foods like beans, tofu, or lentils, you can cut significant amounts of your daily calorie intake while adding many nutrients to your diet.
12.12
Replace high-calorieside dishes with healthier alternatives. For instance, exchange cheesy pasta or mashed potatoes with steamed vegetables or salad.
13.13
Drinking waterinstead of soda, coffee, alcohol, juice, or milk may help you cut hundreds of calories per day. Increasing your water intake can also help your body efficiently use nutrients, keep you energized, get the most benefit from your exercise routine, and feel full longer. If you can handle substituting water for all other drinks for a week, you can expect faster weight loss and see dramatic improvement in energy levels and even appearance very quickly.
14.14
Avoid tempting grocery aisles. Avoid the areas in the grocery store that stock sodas, cookies, ice cream, pizzas, and other fattening and highly processed foods, so that you are less likely to purchase unhealthy options.
15.15
Prepare your meals at home instead of buying fast food.
16.16
The Mayo Clinic Diet[16].
This plan was developed by the world-renowned medical research and treatment clinic to jump-start weight loss and promote a long-term plan for healthy and sustainable weight loss. It advertises a possible weight loss of up to 10 pounds in the first week, although results slow afterwards. This is one of the few diet plans with immediate weight loss results that are healthy to maintain in the long-term. It focuses on breaking unhealthy habits, creating healthy habits, and learning to eat and exercise well for life.
Exercise More
Remember, you canlose weighteither by decreasing your calorie intake or increasing the number of calories you burn. Any health strategy should include both, but if you want to lose weight fast, exercise is essential. Small changes to your activity level can add up over the course of a day, and can start making an impact on your weight within as little as a week.
1.1
Make time for exercise.
By making time for exercise and other healthy, productive activities, you can avoid temptation to overeat.
Make chores exercise opportunities. Do your own gardening, wash your car to burn calories and get things done around the house.
Don’t pick the most convenient parking spot. Park further from the entrance when you go shopping.
Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
2.2
Be realistic about the type of exercise you can do when starting a new program.
Don’t be discouraged if you have to start out slowly; you can always adjust your routine as you gain skills and confidence.
Even short time intervals of circuit training that combine cardio and fat-burning activities can trim inches off of your waist, arms, and thighs in 2 weeks or less. Participants in Chris Freytag’s 2 week trial[17]lost up to 10 pounds and as many inches when tested byPreventionmagazine readers, with up to 5 pounds lost in the first week after only 6 sessions of 20 minutes each. Many women’s and health magazines as well as personal trainers offer similar condensed workout routines designed to maximize weight loss and visible physical slimming within only a few days of beginning the regimen.
3.3
Adopt a targeted exercise program.
Fat-burning cardio routines can help you lose fat quickly, while weight and resistance training can trigger your metabolism to use energy more efficiently.
Fat-burning exercise routines help you drop fat quickly by targeting fat loss. Having a healthy and balanced diet in combination with moderate fat-burning exercise is essential to prevent muscle loss. Try routines that are heavy on cardio.
In order to lose a pound of fat, you must burn 3,500 calories. The most effective fat-burning routines contain short bursts of high-intensity workouts with interspersed periods of rest.[18]These are also called interval workouts.
4.4
Variety in an exercise regimen is especially important, and can help both those who have reached a weight plateau and those who are just beginning the weight loss process stick with it.
5.5
Choose workouts that require your entire body to exert an effort. This way, you work every muscle group and burn calories with more muscles at one time, like multi-tasking with your exercise.[19]For instance, combine a form of resistance training (try raising small dumbbells overhead as you work) with your arms while you jog or cycle with your legs.
6.6
Perform low impact aerobic activities.
Moderate aerobic workouts incorporating brisk walking, cycling, aerobic machines, or swimming not only burn calories they also keep your heart healthy. Swimming is great, especially if you are quite overweight or have joint problems, because you can get the same benefits of running typically burning even more calories with much less stress on your joints. Try to get at least 30-40 minutes of aerobic exercise at least three or four days per week.
7.7
Pump some iron.
 Resistance training,weight training, can help both men and women stay lean by building muscle and raising metabolism. Weight loss strategies that incorporate both aerobic and weight training boost calorie burn significantly. If you gain muscle, your body’s resting metabolism (the amount of calories you burn when you’re just sitting still) increases. Studies have shown consistent weight training toraise the body’s metabolismby 15%. This means an average woman might burn 200-300 more calories at rest every day. Weight training can also tone flabby “trouble” spots, giving the appearance of weight loss by simply tightening and slimming your body.
8.8
Make exercise enjoyable.
Choosing physical activities that you like to do will make you much more lucky to succeed at maintaining your exercise regimen.
Start a hobby that involves moving around a bit, even if it doesn’t sound like “exercise.” Gardening, building small projects, working on cars, or playing with animals are all great ways to burn calories.
Remember that games like volleyball, tennis, and even Frisbee can help you burn calories while having a blast, making exercise a social and fun activity you will want to enjoy everyday.
Find what you like and don’t be afraid to try new things. Many forms of exercise can help you reach your weight loss goals, even home-training programs such as Wii Fit, which guides you through yoga, aerobics, strength training, and balance exercises in the comfort of your own home.
For more adventurous athletes, programs such as P90-X can also provide dramatic weight loss benefits through exercise.
9.9
Get enough rest.
Being properly rested will help you maintain sufficient energy throughout the day, making you less likely to overeat and less prone to injury during physical activity.
Rest at least 24 to 48 hours between strength training sessions on the same muscle group (for instance, work out your biceps and abs on alternating days), and take one to two days off from exercising each week.
Know how much sleep you need, since sleep deficiency impairs your ability to lose fat.
10.10
Try cooking with olive oil instead of other unhealthy types of oils if possible. One of the major benefits of olive oil is that it’s a great source for monounsaturated fats which can help lower Low Density Lipoprotein also known as LDL. This can help protect against atherosclerosis. In addition to this, monounsaturated fats can actually lower the risk of heart disease. The reason for this is because these types of fats do not affect the levels of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), which are also called “good cholesterol”.Cite error; 
Tips
You may be able to reduce your caloric intake by eating slowly; your brain needs about 20 minutes to get the signal that you are not hungry anymore. Taking a breather in between bites can help prevent overeating, provided you pay attention to how full you feel and stop after you are satisfied.
Be realistic but stay optimistic. Set an achievable goal for your weight reduction. If the aim is not practical then you will easily get disheartened and stop follo
wing your regimen. Keep in mind that even with minimal weight loss, toning muscle by weight training can give you a slimmer appearance very quickly.
The goal is to lose fat, not just weight in general. If you are doing strength training during your weight loss (which you should be), you might actually see an initial gain in weight. If this is the case, don’t worry! You have probably lost fat and gained muscle, which is denser than fat and is much healthier

You dont satisfy her the  way u feel you should?»»PERFECT WAYS TO MAKE OUT««

StickySeptember 14, 2013 Ibeh Genius
Leave a comment



While kissing someone you like for even a few seconds can be electrifying or intense enough on its own, making out takes kissing to a new level. If you want to make out the right way, then you have to know how to sustain your passion, mix things up, and make your kissing partner feel appreciated. Whether you’ve been with the same person for a while or you’re kissing someone new, read on to find out how to make out like a pro.

Part One: Initiating the Make Out Session
1.1
Make eye contact.
Meet your kissing partner’s eyes and give him or her a little smile to show that you’re ready for some action. You can also gently lean your forehead against your kissing partner’s, put your hand on his face, or even give him or her a quick peck on the lips before you really start kissing. This helps start a connection and gets your partner more ready to kiss you; if you swoop in without any warning, the kissing session may be unexpected — and not in a good way.
Your eye contact doesn’t have to be super intense, especially if you’re just starting out with this person. Just a few seconds of eye contact should get the message across.
2.2
Move slowly and gently.
 This is very important. The best way to prevent head-butting, elbowing, and clanking teeth is to do everything slowly, especially in the beginning and when you’re changing positions. As time progresses, you can introduce more passionate kissing techniques, but they can only be sustained for so long. Always return to a slow, comfortable pace. Start with a kiss on the lips, then, if you want to French kiss, slowly move your tongue into your partner’s mouth as he or she does the same.
Once your tongues are in each other’s mouths, you can move them slowly in a circular motion, move them on top of each other, or do whatever feels good without moving too fast or getting sloppy.
Remember that if you’remaking out for the first time, you have to be extra cautious before you begin. The first time is about figuring out the person’s comfort level, boundaries, and favorite maneuvers.
3.3
Keep your hands busy. 
This doesn’t mean that you should frantically paw your kissing partner every chance you get. However, you’ll be more comfortable kissing if you don’t keep your hands neatly planted on your lap. Once you’re comfortable, and especially if you’re sitting down, try to explore your kissing partner’s body — as long as you’re both okay with it. Basically, just keep your hands moving from time to time, so you don’t get stuck in the same old boring position.
If you’re kissing a man, put your arms around his neck or touch his arms, neck, back of his head, or even his chest.
If you’re kissing a girl, touch her shoulders and her waist, and wait for the signal that she’s ready for more.
4.4
Tease your kissing partner.
 You can still play hard to get in the middle of a make out session. When it’s going great, just pull back for a second and look into your kissing partner’s eyes. Locking eyes will be sexy and will make your kissing partner want to kiss you even more badly. Though you shouldn’t try this move all the time, once or twice per make out session will do the trick.
This is also a great move if you need a little break from so much kissing.
5.5
Remember to come up for air.
 Taking a little break from kissing is perfectly fine and can even help get you back into the kissing mindset. If you’re tired but don’t want to stop yet, just come up for air, slow down your kissing pace, or don’t be afraid to take a quick bathroom break or ask for a glass of water. If you’re not feeling comfortable with so much kissing, then you won’t be able to enjoy yourself or give your best effort.
It’s okay. Taking a break from time to time will actually make you a better kisser.
Tips
Making out involves more than just your lips; depending on the level of relationship, move your hands towards more sensitive zones, or wrap your legs around your partner or move your hips in closer. But make sure your partner is ready and work up to it slowly.

Dedicated to my first love :)
»I miss yhu..

IBEH GENIUS

Here’s a little story I’ve gotta tell
Bout this girl I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought she was the one for me
Other girls I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I’m like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Girl you broke my heart and now I’m standing here
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I’ve got are these photographs
All I’ve got, all I’ve got
All I’ve got are these photographs
All I’ve got, all I’ve got
All I’ve got is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you

Now baby it’s killing me
I’m saying it’s killing me
The fact that you ain’t around
Baby I’m falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
And baby I’m hurting now
I know you’re a better girl
(When I was your man)
This land is a better land
(When you’re in my world)
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely… hey, hey, hey
All I’ve got, all I’ve got
All I’ve got are these photographs
All I’ve got, all I’ve got
is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
All I’ve got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don’t wanna be stuck in the past
But you’re all that I have that I had
And I don’t wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you’re my superstar
I’d give anything, baby here’s my heart
My heart, my heart…

My heart don’t stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it’s over
Girl I’ve been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma’s sofa
Girl I got this lovey dovey o my photo album

You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl why couldnt I be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
I am not the one
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn’t you be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn’t you be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
All I’ve got, all I’ve got
Is nothing without you
All I’ve got, all I’ve got
Is nothing without you
You, you,
Is nothing without you
You, you,
Is nothing without you
All I’ve got, is nothing without
All I’ve got are these photographs
All I’ve got are these photographs

The world has turned his back on me
Every colour has turned black for me
The road has become too narrow
How do I get to tomorrow?
My cup has ran empty
My dreams are still plenty
All I got in my pocket is my hands
Oh, and some sand
I’ll hold myself high
I will learn to fly
I will never give up
I’ll never leave up
I see the future
It’s a pretty picture
the reason I smile.

Gulder Ultimate Search, Bigger, Better And Back! Register Now & Follow @GulderNG #GUSTheMission

Gulder, a leading lager brand from the stables of Nigerian Breweries, is back again with its world-famous physical contest show GulderUltimate Search. The longest running ‘100% local-content’ entertainment programme in Nigeria.
 
At a media gathering, on July 1st 2014 at the Nigerian Breweries Head Quarters in Lagos, the producers promised another thrilling season of adventure, suspense and drama.
 
Gulder Ultimate Search has been a proud advocate of Nigerian tourism, from the rocky landscape of Jos-Shere hills to the wooded forests of Awka Ibom- Usaka Jungle, and will for the first time take place in South East Anambra, in the jungle of Aguleri.
 
The show, which premiered in 2004, has so far produced all male winners and many are beginning to wonder if a woman will ever win the coveted title. However, last season’s last woman standing, Ifunaya Onike, felt confident that this year will be it for the women, having come so close herself and making it to the final three.
 
“At Nigerian Breweries, we are always keen to foster our position as an advocate of leadership, determination and greatness which is why we developed the concept of Gulder Ultimate Search.” The Marketing Manager, Gulder, Emmanuel Agu commented.
 
This will be the 11th edition of Gulder Ultimate Search, and this year’s crowned champion will walk away with 10million naira, as well as a brand new SUV.
 
“The Gulder brand will also create opportunities for some other individuals, other than the ‘Ultimate Champion’, to go home with their dreams on wheels. But you have to stay glued to your TV screens to find out more”. Said Marketing Manager, Emmanuel Agu
 
The suspense and excitement has already begun as guests were treated to an exclusive first viewing of the Call For Entry TVC, which featured two of the previous winners embarking on a mission to find a mysterious item called ‘The Cube’.
 
Details of the show continue to remain shrouded in mystery. Who will be this year’s Anchorman? What new thrills lie in wait for the fans? And will we finally see an ‘Ultimate Woman’ crowned?
 
The glamorous event had in attendance notable personalities including renowned OAP Olisa Adibua and popular musician, 2shotz.
 
Call for entry is open from now until the 31st of July

Unilag Student Shot in the Head (Photo)

Leave a comment




A student was reportedly shot in the head by
unidentified gunmen on Monday at the King Jaja Hall
area of the University of Lagos, Lagos State.
The student who was identified as Sapara, a final year
student of Philosophy, had his face covered in blood
after a bullet was said to have scraped the side of his
head.

He was subsequently taken to the Lagos University
Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, and official report had it
that he was in stable condition.
The incident however led to chaos as students were
seen running in different directions after the gunshot
was heard.
Eyewitnesses say they saw a car speed off after the
shooting, noting that the perpetrators might have
carried out the attack from there.
Speaking in an interview with our correspondent, the
Dean of Students’ Affairs of the University, Prof.
Olukayode Amund, confirmed that Sapara was indeed
shot and currently recuperating at LUTH.
He stated that investigations had begun to unravel the
circumstances surrounding the attack, after which
requisite actions would be taken.
He said, “The events surrounding the incident are still
unknown and by the time we conclude our
investigation, the university authority will take the
necessary and appropriate action. Our security
operatives are working very hard to unravel the mystery
and whoever is responsible will be held to account.”
When asked whether the attack was carried out by
cultists, Amund noted that though it was not yet
confirmed, it was a likely possibility.
According to him, only cultists are known to carry out
operations of this nature.
And although normal day-to-day activities went on at
the university on Tuesday as students went about
writing their ongoing examinations, some are weary
that reprisal actions could take place.

The Super Eagles Coach, Stephen Keshi, on Friday said he will continue coaching the Super Eagles if his contract with the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, is extended.
Keshi told journalists in Abuja that he would love to finish what he started with the team if given the opportunity.
“Although I have not spoken with the NFF yet, I am out of contract now and I need to move ahead.
“I have spent two and a half years in Nigeria and I love Nigeria, it is my country and the national team is in my blood.
“If I meet with the NFF and we agree to the conditions in a new contract, there is no problem.
“There are many countries like South Africa that are seeking my service; but I will give priority to Nigeria if we agree because I will love to finish what I started if everything goes on well.
Keshi said if his contract is not extended, he will go elsewhere for the experience.
He expressed optimism that the Super Eagles would be a team to reckon with in few years to come if the players are kept intact.
“There is a lot of potential in the team because they are players, who, in the next three to four years, Nigerians should be proud of.
“But that is if we continue with this group of players with some additional ones”, Keshi said.

Mark Zuckerberg
Facebook turned 10 this year and no one was celebrating harder than CEO Mark Zuckerberg. After seeing his company past the growing pains of a disastrous May 2012 IPO, Zuckerberg has the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company flying high.
Facebook’s shares are up more than 130% over the past year as of Feb. 2014, enabling blockbuster deals like the $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp and more than doubling Zuck’s net worth over the same period, even after he gifted away 18 million shares in late December. 
He sold more than 41 million shares and exercised 60 million options around that time as well. Once a laughing stock because of its Nasdaq fiasco, Facebook has recovered with huge improvements in mobile revenue, with many congratulating Zuckerberg for refocusing the company on translating eyeballs into dollars. 
The Facebook cofounder continues to remain politically active, staying the course with his lobbying group FWD.us despite its rocky initial public reception. The group focuses on advocating for immigration reform and the improvement of science and technology education.

Aliko Dangote (Ceo Dangote Group)
Africa’s richest man is looking beyond cement, sugar and flour–the three commodities that built his fortune–to the oil business. 
In April, he announced $9 billion in financing from a consortium of local and international lenders to construct a private oil refinery, fertilizer and petrochemical complex in the country. 
His publicly traded Dangote Cement is also grabbing new markets in Africa, with $750 million in new plants planned for Kenya and Niger.
 He made his first fortune more than three decades ago when he started trading commodities with a loan from his powerful uncle.

25 Killer Actions to Boost Your Self-Confidence: Everything is possible if you bieleve in yourself- Ibeh Genius


Image

February 15, 2014 Ibeh Genius
Leave a comment




 Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit. – E.E. Cummings
One of the things that held me back from pursuing my dreams for many years was fear of failure … and the lack of self-confidence that I needed to overcome that fear.
It’s something we all face, to some degree, I think. The key question: how do you overcome that fear?

By working on your self-confidence and self-esteem. Without really thinking of it in those terms, that’s what I’ve been doing over the years, and that’s what helped me finally overcome my fears, and finally pursue my dreams.
I still have those fears, undoubtedly. But now I know that I can beat them, that I can break through that wall of fear and come out on the other side. I’ve done it many times now, and that success will fuel further success.
This post was inspired by MGN reader Nick from Finland, who asked for an article about self-worth and self-confidence:
Many of the things you propose make people feel better about themselves and actually help building self-confidence. However, I would be interested on reading your input in general on this topic. Taking time out for your own plans and dreams, doing things another way than most other people and generally not necessarily “fitting in” can be quite hard with a low self-confidence.
  Truer words have never been spoken. It’s near impossible to make time for your dreams, to break free from the traditional mold, and to truly be yourself, if you have low self-esteem and self-confidence.


As an aside, I know that some people make a strong distinction between self-esteem and self-confidence. In this article, I use them interchangeably, even if there is a subtle but perhaps important difference … the difference being whether you believe you’re worthy of respect from others (self-esteem) and whether you believe in yourself (self-confidence). In the end, both amount to the same thing, and in the end, the actions I mention below give a boost to both self-esteem and self-confidence.
 Taking control of your self-confidence
If you are low in self-confidence, is it possible to do things that will change that? Is your self-confidence in your control?
While it may not seem so, if you are low in self-confidence, I strongly believe that you can do things to increase your self-confidence. It is not genetic, and you do not have to be reliant on others to increase your self-confidence. And if you believe that you are not very competent, not very smart, not very attractive, etc. … that can be changed.
You can become someone worthy of respect, and someone who can pursue what he wants despite the naysaying of others.
You can do this by taking control of your life, and taking control of your self-confidence. By taking concrete actions that improve your competence, your self-image, you can increase that self-confidence, without the help of anyone else.
Below, I outline 25 things that will help you do that. None of them is revolutionary, none of them will do it all by themselves. The list certainly isn’t comprehensive. These are just some of my favorite things, stuff that’s worked for me.
And you don’t need to do all of them, as if this were a recipe … pick and choose those that appeal to you, maybe just a couple at first, and give them a try. If they work, try others. If they don’t, try others.

Here they are, in no particular order:
 1. Groom yourself.
 This seems like such an obvious one, but it’s amazing how much of a difference a shower and a shave can make in your feelings of self-confidence and for your self-image. There have been days when I turned my mood around completely with this one little thing.
2. Dress nicely.
 A corollary of the first item above … if you dress nicely, you’ll feel good about yourself. You’ll feel successful and presentable and ready to tackle the world. Now, dressing nicely means something different for everyone … it doesn’t necessarily mean wearing a $500 outfit, but could mean casual clothes that are nice looking and presentable.
3. Photoshop your self-image.
 Our self-image means so much to us, more than we often realize. We have a mental picture of ourselves, and it determines how confident we are in ourselves. But this picture isn’t fixed and immutable. You can change it. Use your mental Photoshopping skills, and work on your self-image. If it’s not a very good one, change it. Figure out why you see yourself that way, and find a way to fix it.
4. Think positive. 
One of the things I learned when I started running, about two years ago, what how to replace negative thoughts (see next item) with positive ones. How I can actually change my thoughts, and by doing so make great things happened. With this tiny little skill, I was able to train for and run a marathon within a year. It sounds so trite, so Norman Vincent Peale, but my goodness this works. Seriously. Try it if you haven’t.
5. Kill negative thoughts.
 Goes hand-in-hand with the above item, but it’s so important that I made it a separate item. You have to learn to be aware of your self-talk, the thoughts you have about yourself and what you’re doing. When I was running, sometimes my mind would start to say, “This is too hard. I want to stop and go watch TV.” Well, I soon learned to recognize this negative self-talk, and soon I learned a trick that changed everything in my life: I would imagine that a negative thought was a bug, and I would vigilantly be on the lookout for these bugs. When I caught one, I would stomp on it (mentally of course) and squash it. Kill it dead. Then replace it with a positive one. (“C’mon, I can do this! Only one mile left!”)
 Know yourself and you will win all battles. – Sun Tzu   
6. Get to know yourself.
 When going into battle, the wisest general learns to know his enemy very, very well. You can’t defeat the enemy without knowing him. And when you’re trying to overcome a negative self-image and replace it with self-confidence, your enemy is yourself. Get to know yourself well. Start listening to your thoughts. Start writing a journal about yourself, and about the thoughts you have about yourself, and analyzing why you have such negative thoughts. And then think about the good things about yourself, the things you can do well, the things you like. Start thinking about your limitations, and whether they’re real limitations or just ones you’ve allowed to be placed there, artificially. Dig deep within yourself, and you’ll come out (eventually) with even greater self-confidence.
7. Act positive. 
More than just thinking positive, you have to put it into action. Action, actually, is the key to developing self-confidence. It’s one thing to learn to think positive, but when you start acting on it, you change yourself, one action at a time. You are what you do, and so if you change what you do, you change what you are. Act in a positive way, take action instead of telling yourself you can’t, be positive. Talk to people in a positive way, put energy into your actions. You’ll soon start to notice a difference.
8. Be kind and generous. 
Oh, so corny. If this is too corny for you, move on. But for the rest of you, know that being kind to others, and generous with yourself and your time and what you have, is a tremendous way to improve your self-image. You act in accordance with the Golden Rule, and you start to feel good about yourself, and to think that you are a good person. It does wonders for your self-confidence, believe me.
One important key to success is self-confidence. A key to self-confidence is preparation. – Arthur Ashe
9. Get prepared. 
It’s hard to be confident in yourself if you don’t think you’ll do well at something. Beat that feeling by preparing yourself as much as possible. Think about taking an exam: if you haven’t studied, you won’t have much confidence in your abilities to do well on the exam. But if you studied your butt off, you’re prepared, and you’ll be much more confident. Now think of life as your exam, and prepare yourself.
10. Know your principles and live them. 
What are the principles upon which your life is built? If you don’t know, you will have trouble, because your life will feel directionless. For myself, I try to live the Golden Rule (and fail often). This is my key principle, and I try to live my life in accordance with it. I have others, but they are mostly in some way related to this rule (the major exception being to “Live my Passion”). Think about your principles … you might have them but perhaps you haven’t given them much thought. Now think about whether you actually live these principles, or if you just believe in them but don’t act on them.
11. Speak slowly. 
Such a simple thing, but it can have a big difference in how others perceive you. A person in authority, with authority, speaks slowly. It shows confidence. A person who feels that he isn’t worth listening to will speak quickly, because he doesn’t want to keep others waiting on something not worthy of listening to. Even if you don’t feel the confidence of someone who speaks slowly, try doing it a few times. It will make you feel more confident. Of course, don’t take it to an extreme, but just don’t sound rushed either.
12. Stand tall. 
I have horrible posture, so it will sound hypocritical for me to give this advice, but I know it works because I try it often. When I remind myself to stand tall and straight, I feel better about myself. I imagine that a rope is pulling the top of my head toward the sky, and the rest of my body straightens accordingly. As an aside, people who stand tall and confident are more attractive. That’s a good thing any day, in my book.
13. Increase competence.
 How do you feel more competent? By becoming more competent. And how do you do that? By studying and practicing. Just do small bits at a time. If you want to be a more competent writer, for example, don’t try to tackle the entire profession of writing all at once. Just begin to write more. Journal, blog, write short stories, do some freelance writing. The more you write, the better you’ll be. Set aside 30 minutes a day to write (for example), and the practice will increase your competence.
14. Set a small goal and achieve it.
 People often make the mistake of shooting for the moon, and then when they fail, they get discouraged. Instead, shoot for something much more achievable. Set a goal you know you can achieve, and then achieve it. You’ll feel good about that. Now set another small goal and achieve that. The more you achieve small goals, the better you’ll be at it, and the better you’ll feel. Soon you’ll be setting bigger (but still achievable) goals and achieving those too.
15. Change a small habit. 
Not a big one, like quitting smoking. Just a small one, like writing things down. Or waking up 10 minutes earlier. Or drinking a glass of water when you wake up. Something small that you know you can do. Do it for a month. When you’ve accomplished it, you’ll feel like a million bucks.
16. Focus on solutions. 
If you are a complainer, or focus on problems, change your focus now. Focusing on solutions instead of problems is one of the best things you can do for your confidence and your career. “I’m fat and lazy!” So how can you solve that? “But I can’t motivate myself!” So how can you solve that? “But I have no energy!” So what’s the solution?
17. Smile. Another trite one. 
But it works. I feel instantly better when I smile, and it helps me to be kinder to others as well. A little tiny thing that can have a chain reaction. Not a bad investment of your time and energy.
18. Volunteer. 
Related to the “be kind and generous” item above, but more specific. It’s the holiday season right now … can you find the time to volunteer for a good cause, to spread some holiday cheer, to make the lives of others better? It’ll be some of the best time you’ve ever spent, and an amazing side benefit is that you’ll feel better about yourself, instantly.
19. Be grateful. 
I’m a firm believer in gratitude, as anyone who’s been reading this blog for very long knows well. But I put it here because while being grateful for what you have in life, for what others have given you, is a very humbling activity … it can also be a very positive and rewarding activity that will improve your self-image. Read more.
20. Exercise. 
Gosh, I seem to put this one on almost every list. But if I left it off this list I would be doing you a disservice. Exercise has been one of my most empowering activities in the last couple years, and it has made me feel so much better about myself.
All you have to do is take a walk a few times a week, and you’ll see benefits. Start the habit.
21. Empower yourself with knowledge.
 Empowering yourself, in general, is one of the best strategies for building self-confidence. You can do that in many ways, but one of the surest ways to empower yourself is through knowledge. This is along the same vein as building competence and getting prepared … by becoming more knowledgeable, you’ll be more confident … and you become more knowledgeable by doing research and studying. The Internet is a great tool, of course, but so are the people around you, people who have done what you want, books, magazines, and educational institutions.
22. Do something you’ve been procrastinating on. 
What’s on your to-do list that’s been sitting there? Do it first thing in the morning, and get it out of the way. You’ll feel great about yourself.
23. Get active.
 Doing something is almost always better than not doing anything. Of course, doing something could lead to mistakes … but mistakes are a part of life. It’s how we learn. Without mistakes, we’d never get better. So don’t worry about those. Just do something. Get off your butt and get active — physically, or active by taking steps to accomplish something.
24. Work on small things. 
Trying to take on a huge project or task can be overwhelming and daunting and intimidating for anyone, even the best of us. Instead, learn to break off small chunks and work in bursts. Small little achievements make you feel good, and they add up to big achievements. Learn to work like this all the time, and soon you’ll be a self-confident maniac.
25. Clear your desk. 
This might seem like a small, simple thing (then again, for some of you it might not be so small). But it has always worked wonders for me. If my desk starts to get messy, and the world around me is in chaos, clearing off my desk is my way of getting a little piece of my life under control. It is the calm in the center of the storm around me. Here’s how.
 Somehow I can’t believe that there are any heights that can’t be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true. This special secret, it seems to me, can be summarized in four C s. They are curiosity, confidence, courage, and constancy, and the greatest of all is confidence. When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionable. – Walt Disney

About Sexually transmitted diseases (STD)

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)  are infectious diseases that spread from person to person through intimate contact. STDs can affect guys and girls of all ages and backgrounds who are having sex — it doesn’t matter if they’re rich or poor.
Unfortunately, STDs (sometimes also called STIs for “sexually transmitted infections”) have become common among teens. Because teens are more at risk for getting some STDs, it’s important to learn what you can do to protect yourself.

STDs are more than just an embarrassment. They’re a serious health problem. If untreated, some STDs can cause permanent damage, such as infertility (the inability to have a baby) and even death (in the case of HIV/AIDS).

How STDs Spread
One reason STDs spread is because people think they can only be infected if they have sexual intercourse. That’s wrong. A person can get some STDs, like herpes or genital warts, through skin-to-skin contact with an infected area or sore.

Another myth about STDs is that you can’t get them if you have oral or anal sex. That’s also wrong because the viruses or bacteria that cause STDs can enter the body through tiny cuts or tears in the mouth and anus, as well as the genitals.

STDs also spread easily because you can’t tell whether someone has an infection. In fact, some people with STDs don’t even know that they have them. These people are in danger of passing an infection on to their sex partners without even realizing it.
Some of the things that increase a person’s chances of getting an STD are:

Sexual activity at a young age. The younger a person starts having sex, the greater his or her chances of becoming infected with an STD.
Lots of sex partners. People who have sexual contact — not just intercourse, but any form of intimate activity — with many different partners are more at risk than those who stay with the same partner.
Unprotected sex. Latex condoms are the only form of birth control that reduce your risk of getting an STD, and must be used every time. Spermicides, diaphragms, and other birth control methods may help prevent pregnancy, but they don’t protect a person against STDs.

Preventing and Treating STDs 
As with many other diseases, prevention is key. It’s much easier to prevent STDs than to treat them. The only way to completely prevent STDs is to abstain from all types of sexual contact. If someone is going to have sex, the best way to reduce the chance of getting an STD is by using a condom every time (or a dental dam when a girl is receiving oral sex).
People who are considering having sex should get regular gynecological or male genital examinations. There are two reasons for this. First, these exams give doctors a chance to teach people about STDs and protecting themselves. And second, regular exams give doctors more opportunities to check for STDs while they’re still in their earliest, most treatable stage.
In order for these exams and visits to the doctor to be helpful, people need to tell their doctors if they are thinking about having sex or if they have already started having sex. This is true for all types of sex — oral, vaginal, and anal. And let the doctor know if you’ve ever had any type of sexual contact, even if it was in the past.
Don’t let embarrassment at the thought of having an STD keep you from seeking medical attention. Waiting to see a doctor may allow a disease to progress and cause more damage. If you think you may have an STD, or if you have had a partner who may have an STD, you should see a doctor right away.

If you don’t have a doctor or prefer not to see your family doctor, you may be able to find a local clinic in your area where you can get an exam confidentially. Some national and local organizations operate STD hotlines staffed by trained specialists who can answer your questions and provide referrals. Calls to these hotlines are confidential. One hotline you can call for information is the National STD Hotline at 1-800-227-8922.
Not all infections in the genitals are caused by STDs. Sometimes people can get symptoms that seem very like those of STDs, even though they’ve never had sex. For girls, a yeast infection can easily be confused with an STD. Guys may worry about bumps on the penis that turn out to be pimples or irritated hair follicles. That’s why it’s important to see a doctor if you ever have questions about your sexual health.

What To Do When You Don’t Know What to Do -Ibeh Genius


Image

February 7, 2014 Ibeh Genius
2 Comments




“He who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg.” ~Chinese Proverb
Here’s the thing: I don’t know what to do.
About this thing, about that thing. About big things and small things.
About anything.
Actually, to be honest, even the smallest thing seems big when I don’t know what to do about it. The state of “not knowing what to do” is like some kind of Miracle Grow for small things in my mind.
This is not a new thing. Not knowing what to do is a particular and well-honed talent of mine. I can even juggle several not knowing what-to-dos at once.
For example, at the moment I don’t know whether to go away with my friends this weekend or not. And if I do will I take the train? Or get a lift?
I don’t know whether to take that new job. And if I do, when should I start it? What about all those other job offers that will flood through the door the minute I say yes to this one?
I don’t know whether to start the diet tomorrow. Or today. Or next week. Or not at all. I don’t know whether to call my counselor or ride this one out alone.
I don’t know what is best, what is right. I don’t know what I want to do.
Do you know what else I don’t know? I don’t know what to do about not knowing what to do.
And whenever I feel like this (which is not always, but often), I start not knowing what to do about things I did know what to do about before. Things I had already made  decisions on, things I felt excited and sure about before, now feel wobbly and wrong. Even though I know the decisions felt right when I made them.
My brain starts questioning it all: What if I didn’t really know what to do then either, and just decided on something that wasn’t really the right thing to do after all? What if it turns out to be “wrong”? What if I acted on impulse and didn’t think it all through properly?
It’s like I’m mourning all the other possible options that will never, ever happen now because I didn’t choose them.
The little voice in my head chides me: If you choose option a, then such and such might happen, which could lead to x and then that may mean y. Had I known in the beginning about y, maybe I wouldn’t have chosen that original thing. Or would I? How do I know? 
And this uncertainty, the worry, the anxiety, the not knowing, it isn’t picky. It doesn’t just stick to the thing I’m not sure about. It leaks. It seeps into everything else, so instead of feeling uncertain or anxious about one thing in particular, about one decision specifically, I feel anxious, uncertain, and worried full stop. I forget what started it. I just feel it.
I feel it in my chest, near my heart. In my throat. It feels like guilt, muddled with regret, with overtones of panic and an undercurrent of fear. It feels hard and cold, like a vice-like grip.
And I don’t like it. But I just don’t know what to do about it. So I do nothing. Except worry and be anxious that doing nothing is not the right thing to do. It’s exhausting, it’s frustrating, and it’s totally and utterly unproductive.
And the only thing that makes it stop? Is to just decide and do something. To just do anything.
And the only way to know what to do? Well actually, there is no answer to that one.
Other than to not worry about worrying. To not feel anxious about feeling anxious. To accept that there is no right answer.
To breathe. To try to feel beyond the worry, to try to feel the answer rather than (over) think it.
To stop trying to second-guess every possible outcome of every possible decision. To stop trying to control and account for every accountability.
It just isn’t possible.
To trust.
I can’t know what will happen. I can’t know how I will feel about any of it. I can’t know whether the decision I make is any better or worse than any other decision I could have made because I am only ever going to experience the one path I do choose.
So I can only react with what I have, what I know, and how I feel, right here and right now. And I don’t need to know how to do that; I just need to do it. I just need to allow it to happen.
Back to my decisions. Well, I still don’t know what to do. I still don’t know what the “right” thing is.
But maybe that’s not so much of a problem after all.
Because I do know what the wrong thing is. And that’s to make no decision at all. Even if the decision I make is not to decide just yet—that is still a decision. Own it.
A friend once said to me, “Whenever the time is right, it will be the right time.” It helps me relax about my decisions.
I often wonder: Am I the only one like this? I don’t know that either, but if you’re with me:
Stop thinking it through. Stop making up what might happen. Because that’s what’s happening here, you’re just making it up. 
Just make the decision instead and enjoy the ride. Whatever it turns out to be, it doesn’t really matter—you can change it later if you really have to.
Whatever the decision is, just make it. What’s the worst that can happen, really?
Just make the decision and then be glad you did. Enjoy the freedom and the relief that follows.

Enjoy the present, indecision free. Because while you’re busy worrying about what might happen tomorrow, guess what? You’re missing out on all the great stuff happening today.
So just decide. Just relax.
Want to know the good news? The decision thing is just as leaky as the indecision thing.
Once I get going again, I know there’ll be no stopping me. I’ll breeze through decisions that floored me before. I’ll put those small things back in their place. And if it feels wrong, I’ll change it. I won’t worry about it. Things that felt a bit wrong and weird before just won’t matter anymore.
I won’t know where this whole confident, decision making thing came from. I’ll just feel it.
I’ll feel it in my chest, near my heart. It will feel like contentment, embracing joy, tickled with peace and flavored with lightness. It will feel soft and warm, like molten honey trickling through my veins. It will make me smile.
And I will love it. And I will do all I can to hold on to it.
That I do know.
So let’s just get started. Let’s just relax. Let’s just decide. And let’s never look back.
