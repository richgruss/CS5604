They were stolen from their homes, locked in chains and taken across an ocean. And for more than 200 years,
their blood and sweat would help to build the richest and most powerful nation the world has ever known. But
when slavery ended, their welcome was over.
America's wealthy elite had decided it was time for them to disappear and they were not particular about how it might be
done. What you are about to see is that the plan these people set in motion 150 years ago is still being carried out today. So
don't think that this is history. It is not. It is happening right here, and it's happening right now.

You are so true this movie is too explosive for Hollywood. Thank you "Life Dynamics" for this AMAZING tool! Edmund Burke said "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men [and women] do nothing." Let this not be true for those of us given the blessed opportunity to see, hear and experience "Mafa21." May each one accept the call to expose those who choose lies instead of truth, death instead of life and evil instead of good. Let it not be said "you knew the truth, but turned a blind eye. For after viewing this, God takes no excuses!Lynn of Chattaooga
