PETITION URGENTLY REQUESTING THAT CONGRESS OPEN AN INDEPENDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF ELECTION FRAUD AND ABUSE IN VARIOUS FORMS, TO ASSURE THAT ALL FUTURE ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE AS FREE, FAIR AND ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE.



To: All members of the U.S. Congress:
Whereas, before, during and after the election of Nov. 6, 2012, many credible reports have been published documenting voter registration fraud, actual vote fraud, lost military ballots, millions of deceased people on voter rolls, computerized voting machines automatically “defaulting” to “Democrat,” and many other disturbing irregularities;     
Whereas, in 59 different Philadelphia voting divisions, Mitt Romney received zero votes compared to Obama’s 19,605, a result experts consider statistically almost impossible;
Whereas, in 10 counties in Colorado, another closely contested state, more people were found to be registered to vote than the number of people of voting age residing in those counties, with the disparity between total registrations and total voting-age population ranging between 104 to 140 percent in those counties;
Whereas, disturbing news stories report that some computerized voting machines automatically converted Romney votes into Obama votes; 
Whereas, ongoing concerns over the de facto disenfranchisement of members of America’s armed forces are borne out by reports like the June 27, 2012, McClatchy newspaper story headlined, “Tens of thousands of service members’ votes not counted,” as well as the shocking findings of the Military Voter Protection Project which reported that in 2010, out of the approximately 2 million military and overseas voters accounted for in data reported by the states to the Election Assistance Commission, less than 5 percent – only 1 out of 20 – of those voters were able to cast an absentee ballot that counted;   
Whereas, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Eric Holder has arguably encouraged voter intimidation by refusing to prosecute the most egregious case of voter intimidation in modern times, that of club-wielding New Black Panther Party members in camouflage fatigues standing in front of the door of a Philadelphia polling place in 2008; 
Whereas, one long-time Justice Department attorney, J. Christian Adams, who actually resigned from DOJ in protest of Holder’s race-based application of the law, confirms that: 1) many “states are infested with dead voters on the rolls,” 2) Justice Department “investigations into eight states with widespread voter roll problems … were spiked,” and 3) “Data show that illegal aliens are participating in American elections”;
Whereas, the Justice Department also has insisted on legally challenging states that have attempted to institute basic voter-ID laws to assure fair and accurate elections by verifying the identity of those voting;
Whereas, on Nov. 6 Mitt Romney won every state requiring voter photo ID, while Obama won in closely contested States that require no voter ID, including Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nevada, Colorado and Pennsylvania;
Whereas, reports of illegal activities on the part of poll workers abound, including photographic proof of an Obama “hope and change” poster on the inside wall of a polling place and poll workers wearing Obama baseball caps, as well as Senate candidate Wendy Long, an attorney who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, telling Fox News that when she voted, “a poll worker who was at the scanner studied my private ballot and proceeded to tell me that it was rejected because I did not ‘fill in every space.’ She then proceeded to indicate that I should mark the Democratic line all the way down”;
Whereas, a WND investigation has proven that Barack Obama’s presidential re-election campaign repeatedly accepted illegal foreign donations – specifically, credit card donations made from a foreign (Pakistani) IP address and proxy server in the name of “Osama bin Laden,” and that WND’s complaint is now being probed by the Federal Elections Commission: 
SIGN THE PETITION
We, the undersigned, strongly request that Congress immediately undertake a full and impartial investigation into the multiplicity of issues serving to degrade America’s historically free and fair election system, thereby dangerously eroding citizens’ belief their vote counts and that elections are meaningful. Should the widespread belief that our elections are corrupt (as in some Third World nations) ever take hold in America, chaos and anarchy will undoubtedly follow. Therefore, it is of the very highest importance that Congress take the necessary steps to assure that America’s elections are accurate and fair, and without even a hint of fraud or corruption.
