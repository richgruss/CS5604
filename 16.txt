Big Bro 2.0: Obama Tracking Donors 

 

If you are subscriber to Barack Obama’s campaign e-mails, then it did not take you long to figure out “Obama For America” (OFA) lacks any substance, whatsoever.
The primary focus is getting the masses to donate to their campaign, and they even employ tracking to relentlessly hound their subscribers until they submit, and become donors. Like the famous Orwellian movie says, “big brother is indeed watching.”
The below email is a good example of Obama for America’s not-so subtle manipulation of the masses:
Friend —
Today, just 72 hours after joining the GOP ticket, Paul Ryan is making a pilgrimage to the Sands’ Venetian casino in Las Vegas to kiss the ring of Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate who’s already donated more than $35 million to Republican groups in this election.
That’s the same Sheldon Adelson who gave $15 million to help Newt Gingrich against Mitt Romney in the primary, and said he may give $100 million — basically, whatever it costs — to defeat Barack Obama.
We’re starting to get a glimpse of how Romney plans to cash in on his vice presidential pick. Before Ryan’s even been fully introduced to the American people, he’s attending a private fundraiser in Vegas with the top super PAC donor.
We’re doing this differently, with ordinary people chipping in whatever they can afford — but it’s going to take a lot more of us to match them. Will you donate $3 or more today?
https://donate.barackobama.com/The-Fourth-Day
Thanks,
Julianna
Julianna Smoot
Deputy Campaign Manager
Obama for America
The Obama for America campaign is not focused on the people, they show no concern for unemployment, and offer no plan to fix the dismal, inflationary-economy—their central plan is focused on how much money they can squeeze out of you to donate to them.
Having registered to receive them, the emails seem to have been written by MoveOn.org.  The character and content are identical, “Republicans are liars and only do the bidding of the rich.”
As if people really want to elect a man who hates any part of America, once again. We are all Americans and according to the US Constitution, we have gotten a long way away from the ideal of a “free and equal society.”
In fact, Article 1 Section 8 states, ‘all taxes throughout the United States of America shall be uniform.’
But the  e-mail I received today is a cause for great concern:
Listen up: 
Ann Marie Habershaw, BarackObama.com to you

 Friend –This week, we need to make some of the last, tough choices about what the final push of this grassroots organization will look like — where we can compete and how fiercely.

It’s a close race, and you hold the power here. According to our records associated with this exact email address:– 

Your supporter ID is: 101350xxxx
– Most recent donation: $0
– Total amount donated in 2012:$0

It looks like you haven’t given yet.

That may be because you gave using a different email address than you’re using now — if we’ve got this wrong, I apologize.But if you indeed have not yet given, there’s still time. Just not very much — this Friday is one of our last opportunities to plan for the final weeks of this campaign.

Can you give $5 or more today ahead of this Friday’s big budget deadline? That’s just 19 cents for each day we have left.

We’re looking at what we have in the bank by Friday at midnight in order to determine how many more offices we can open, how many new field organizers we can hire, and how fiercely we can compete in critical battleground states.As we face these difficult decisions, the

President needs your support if we’re going win. Chip in $5 or more now, before the big budget deadline:https://donate.barackobama.com/DecisionsThanks,Ann MarieAnn Marie Habershaw

Chief Operating Officer
Obama for America

P.S. — A little perspective. If we win this election, ordinary Americans will have sent a powerful message to outside groups and special interests: We’ve got this.



Do you like the title of the mailing?  Listen up:  This is something parents say to their children to get their attention. Some on the street just yell, “YO!” and then tell the person a thing or two.  What does Ann Marie want to tell me?


They know I am not a contributor, and use the information in an attempt to force my contribution:

– Your supporter ID is: 101350xxxx
– Most recent donation: $0
– Total amount donated in 2012: $0



They are tracking each and every one of us who sign up for  e-mails, which sounds eerily similar to “Flag-gate” when the White House sent out unsolicited, bulk spam in 2009 regarding Obamacare.


Now, I admit to giving up some of my privacy by providing my e-mail address, but don’t you think that this should give one pause?  Notice how they place the sentence about if you haven’t given in bold text.  I wonder if I will be on a special list after the election.  It won’t matter if Romney wins.


I did receive one e mail in September that gave me some real hope.  That is until I opened it and saw the title: “It’s officially over.” My gut feeling is he should have waited until after he got beat down in the first debate by Mitt Romney.


This guy has got to go!
