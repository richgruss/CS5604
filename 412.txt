UKIP can Win the Election in 2015

1
Dec


By Peter Paton
It’s quite conceivable that come the 2015 Election the Tory & Labour vote will collapse, and the Liberals vanish and #UKIP will win the General Election outright, as that Massive Surge of EU Migrants  this year, has turned many people against the Three Ruling Parties in Britain  and #UKIP will capitalize on the Electoral Fall Out.  #UKIP are already polling heavily amongst disenchanted Tory, Labour and Liberal voters. This new surge of EU Migrants  is the last straw for British voters.
Half a million immigrants pour into UK in one year | UK | News | Daily Express http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/445762/Half-a-million-immigrants-pour-into-UK-in-one-year … #Ukip
David Cameron’s Achilles Heel is Mass Immigration and the shocking statistics show he is failing in his mandate. Because Cameron has failed to deliver his net migration promise to 10’s of thousands + net migration above 250k, he and the Tories are TOAST in 2015. Provided #UKIP runs a professional campaign, media savvy and contains strong discipline, then yes conceivable, that #UKIP will win the 2015 Election, on the issues that are Ultra Important to the British people..
With #UKIP winning the 2014 Euro Elections, and the Douglas Carsewell Defection Bye Election, with Mark Reckless’s Defection Bye Election soon to come, then this Winning Momentum will be behind them going into the General Election in 2015. With the hubris and anger over Mass Immigration into Britain crippling all our services, taking jobs and houses away from British people, and causing Gross Over Population in our towns and cities, – Polling Day would be seen as a War Time Election in 2015, where everything is at stake for Britain, and a conceivable win for #UKIP would be on the cards. Think, Conceive and Achieve #UKIP
