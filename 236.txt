In most aspects of life, there are ‘cants’ and there are ‘wonts.’  When it comes to deposing John Boehner as Speaker of the House on Tuesday, there are only wonts.  All excuses for lacking the ability to fire him have been discredited. Below are some of the myths that are circulating regarding the Speaker’s election.
As the effort to fire Boehner grows, some members who are sitting on the fence are looking for any excuse under the sun to avoid the effort.  None of them can or will publicly vouch for Boehner and defend his support for amnesty, violation of the rules of the House, and false promises to his conference.  So they are opting for excuses by claiming that there is no way to get rid of him or that there is no alternative to Boehner, aside from Nancy Pelosi.  Politicians peddling that premise at this point are either willfully misleading their constituents or are woefully uninformed about the rules of the House and the latest political developments.  Either way it is unacceptable.




As the effort to fire Boehner grows, some members who are sitting on the fence are looking for any excuse under the sun to avoid the effort.  



As noted before, even without an alternative, members are free to vote for whomever they choose when their name is called by the Clerk of the House. If 29 members vote for someone other than Boehner, the process goes to a second ballot and a brokered conference meeting. That is where conservatives' leverage begins to negotiate concessions from the inevitable litany of people who will toss their hat into the ring.
But the supposition of Republicans not being given an alternative is irrelevant at this point.
There are now two official alternative candidates – Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) – who will be nominated on the floor by fellow members. And perhaps there will be more to come.
 





Consequently, any member who claims that he is compelled to vote for Boehner because there is no alternative is either disingenuous or misguided.


            Consequently, any member who claims that he is compelled to vote for Boehner because there is no alternative is either disingenuous or misguided.  In fact, the only way Boehner can survive is if all the members who claim to want him replaced offer a compendium of straw men and false excuses.  

Let’s review some of the myths being promulgated on social media:


Myth: “Not voting for Boehner can help elect Pelosi as Speaker.” 



FACT.  The winner needs an outright majority of those present and voting, which will be roughly 218. Pelosi will never receive more than 188 votes, the number of Democrats in her conference.



Myth: “I have no choice but to vote for Boehner.” 



FACT.  This is not a voice vote by acclimation.  Representatives will be called by the clerk to answer as an individual and now have several other official choices in addition to the standing ability to verbalize any choice of their liking.



Myth: “We need to unite behind one choice or risk splitting the vote.” 



FACT. Given that the Speaker needs an absolute majority of those present and voting, multiple alternatives does not “split the anti-Boehner vote.” Multiple choices only presents additional options for different factions to drive down Boehner’s numbers below a majority.  The objective would be to take this to a second ballot.  For all the accusations that conservatives are purists, they are actually very pragmatic about the need to be open to numerous alternatives. 



Myth: “We might get someone worse in a brokered conference.” 



FACT.  Although conservatives lack the votes to definitively ensure that a rock-star conservative wins the speakership, the same 29 people can veto other unacceptable choices, if one does in fact exist.



Myth: “I might lose my committee assignments if I oppose Boehner.” 



FACT. The committee process has been bypassed by Boehner on numerous occasions resulting in meaningless committee assignments. By 29 members opposing Boehner, the ensuing leverage would allow for negotiating with potential speaker candidates to empower committees and thus decentralize power.
