 Lending a helping hand to Anna's fight against corruption till a brand was formed, maintaining the goal yet parting ways 
as if tracing Gandhi/Netaji split - with or without the guru's 
blessing - yet riding high on the brand so made as if it was a 
gift from the guru, Anna, Kejriwal formed a group. Not quite 
like the 'if you can't beat them join them' his group suddenly 
formed a party with a difference- AAP. And when it shifted the 
dream world from Mumbai to Delhi, and aspiring activists 
from afar to the capital city it suddenly swelled up like an 
overeating newly rich kid. Its acts skyrocketed and a 
revolution was on its way. And when the gathered neurons 
got a light bulb flash to use social media tricks, this despised 
and spoken 
off infant party, suddenly came second in line to the throne in 
Delhi. Like infant Krishna instilling fear on demon Putna, its 
meteorite rise suddenly instilled fear in the hearts of the big 
two - BJP and the Congress. 
Though this victory of an infant party was phenomenal, that 
through ways that defied conventional vote bank politics of 
caste, religion, language and ethnicity - in addition to tall 
promises, Net use and efficient manpower use formed a 
revolution. 
It taught India that minoritism, corruption, charge sheeted legislators and horse trading aren't right. While the latter pre-
empted BJP's Delhi dream despite 'majority', its tricks even found copy cats in the big two. Having split from a guru, 
almost as habits die hard, this new kid in town suddenly became a guru itself. It almost invited a 'promising' prize like 
the one given to Obama. Though, it changed India for good- even if temporarily - its usefulness seems to end there. 
Notwithstanding a deafening silence on the development front 
or absence of governing experience, its good acoustics on the 
fight against corruption almost brought in the emotions invoked 
by freedom slogans. Taking Delhiites by storm and giving them 
a 
promised Messiah, like a viral YouTube video, it almost took 
Indians by storm. Riding high on that wave, and almost seeing 
light at the end of the tunnel - as if it was a near death 
experience, it blissfully eyed the seats in the nation's centre. 
But then, with its centralized diverse brains united by a common 
enemy-corruption- alone like the Syrian opposition, all 
pleasing manifesto itself doesn't sound easy- unless vetoed by 
its oligarchs. Even if done, fielding less scrutinised 
incorrupt candidates nationwide in a short time could prove, 
logistically impractical. With its own victory being unfeasible 
and the feasible thing being the cutting of winner's votes, its success could sadly form ineffective hung parliament. With 
the nation desperate for a clear victor to implement 
development plans and to recreate India shining, this could 
be a 
disaster for India. In relation to its opposition bench plans, 
majority alone changes things unless minority becomes 
unruly.
Luckily for India, it is going downhill on donations, prestige 
and popularity. 
Unless external funding or a deal with Congress to stop 
BJP is proven to hint Egypt like a planned beginning, a 
planned bureaucratic noncooperation - as was done to 
Islamic Brotherhood's Morsi - to thwart the threat to 
ruler/ruled equation by the two big two, could have caused 
its 'fall'. More so, however, while an unconventional 
electioneering brought it to power, an equally 
unconventional way of rule is bringing it down. For example, despite electioneering brilliance, its lack of vision on threats 
from fans not foes, lack of respect for republic day, office and official secrecy despite oath, and use 
of quick fix agitations not formal procedures have brought frown even among its intellectual admirers. While modification 
of election promises has dismayed hopefuls, its alleged inflexible dictatorial ways have brought resignations and 
expulsions.
In view of the above, even if its rise was good for India and Delhi, its 'demise' is a good news for India.
