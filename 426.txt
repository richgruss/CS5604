Two new commissioners to the Elections Commission have taken their oaths of office in front of President Abdulla Yameen today. 

They are Mohmaed Shakeel and Ahmed Sulaiman, who were sworn in by Juvenile Court's Judge Ahmed Shakeel. 

Just today, the two got their stamp of approval from parliament, where they both received 54 votes in favour in parliament, while 16 voted against. 

Four people had applied for the position of being an Elections Commissioner.

During the committee stages of reviewing applicants in parliament, Mohamed Shakeel got a score of 86 out of a hundred while Ahmed Sulaiman got 83.

The two spots on the Elections Commission were made vacant when the Supreme Court ruled that then President of the commission Fuad Thowfeeq and Vice President Ahmed Fayaz were no longer legally eligible to be on the commission.
