Faruk Iya, the Campaign Coordinator of Takai 2015, announced the nomination of Mr. Abba at a news conference in Kano on Saturday.
Mr. Iya said the decision to nominate Mr. Abba was made by the party’s leaders and was based on his personal track record of service and commitment to the party.
Mr. Abba contested with Mr. Takai during the recent PDP gubernatorial primaries in the state.
He came second while Takai won the ticket.
