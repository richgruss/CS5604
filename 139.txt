                            Set of three Republican elephants circa 1930s - these little ceramic razor banks were advertising freebies given out by the Listerine company with the purchase of their shaving cream during the 1936 presidential election (the promotion also included little donkeys). They have a slit in the top for dropping in razor blades and a small drain hole on the bottom - so cute - they look like tiny piggy banks! These are just super-special, fun little guys!This set of three is in wonderful condition - they have no chips or cracks but each has a bit of crazing due to age. All are marked. Approximately 2.5" Height x 3.25" LengthAll items are carefully wrapped and packaged for shipping. This set will ship USPS insured with delivery confirmation. Please convo if you have any questions. Thank you!Back to our shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/RetroHomeAndHardware
