Summary

Here’s summary of a momentous election result for the future of Greece and Europe:

The anti-austerity far left party Syriza has won the Greek election by a decisive margin, but just short of an outright majority. With more than three-quarters of the results in Syriza is projected to win 149 seats in the 300 seat parliament. 
Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said his party’s victory marked an end to the “viscious cycle of austerity”. Referring to the neoliberal conditions set by the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, he said: “ The verdict of the Greek people renders the troika a thing of the past for our common European framework.”
Outgoing prime minister Antonis Samaras conceded defeated by acknowledging some mistakes. But he added: “We restored Greece’s international credibility”. 
To Potami, the centre-left party could be the kingmakers in the new parliament, with a project 16 seats. Its leader Stavros Theodorakis has not ruled out a deal with Syriza. “It’s too early for such details,” he said. 
The far-right Golden Dawn party is projected to come third in election, despite having more than half of its MPs in jail. Speaking from prison its leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos said the result was a “great victory” for the neo-fascist party.
Syriza victory has been greeted with alarm in Germany. The ruling CDU party insisting that Greece should stick to the austerity programme. But Belgium’s finance minister said there is room for negotiation with Syriza.
Leftwingers across Europe have hailed Syriza win. Spain’s anti-austerity party Podemos said Greece finally had a government rather than a German envoy. Britain’s Green Party said Syriza’s victory was an inspiration.

At least one European finance minister has conceded that there could be scope for negotiation with Syriza, AP reports. 

Belgium’s finance minister sees some room to discuss the “modalities” of the Greek debt programme with the other eurozone nations after Syriza’s election victory. 
 Johan Van Overtveldt said on the eve of a eurozone finance ministers’ meeting that “we can talk modalities, we can talk debt restructuring, but the cornerstone that Greece must respect the rules of monetary union that must stay as it is.”
 He told VRT network that even if some things could be changed to accommodate the demands of Syriza, “it is impossible to fundamentally change things.”

 10.11pm GMT17:11 

AP has this account of the Tsipras victory speech:

A triumphant Alexis Tsipras told Greeks that his radical left Syriza party’s win in meant an end to austerity and humiliation and that the country’s regular and often fraught debt inspections were a thing of the past.
 “The sovereign Greek people today have given a clear, strong, indisputable mandate. Greece has turned a page. Greece is leaving behind the destructive austerity, fear and authoritarianism. It is leaving behind five years of humiliation and pain,” Tsipras said to a crowd of rapturous flag-waving party supporters.
 The 40-year-old Tsipras campaigned on promises of renegotiating the terms for Greece’s €240 billion-euro bailout, which has kept the debt-ridden country afloat since mid-2010.
 To qualify for the cash, Greece has had to impose deep and bitterly-resented public spending, salary and pension cuts and repeated tax hikes. Its progress in reforms is reviewed by debt inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank, collectively known as the “troika,” before each installment of bailout funds can be disbursed.
 “The verdict of the Greek people ends, beyond any doubt, the vicious circle of austerity in our country,” Tsipras said. “The verdict of the Greek people, your verdict, annuls today in an indisputable fashion the bailout agreements of austerity and disaster. The verdict of the Greek people renders the troika a thing of the past for our common European framework.”

 9.02pm GMT16:02 

Germany and Syriza are about to enter a high stakes poker game, writes Louise Osborne in Berlin. 

Julian Rappold, a political analyst at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), says the German government would not have wished for such a strong result for Syriza and now faces possible renegotiation while also having to appease the German public.
“A haircut is non-negotiable from the German side, first and foremost because of the strong public opinion against the haircut, so I don’t think Germany is likely to give that concession,” he said. “If the result of the negotiations is presented in the German public as something which is broadly in line with German interests, I think it won’t be a problem, but if the concessions are considered to be high, it will be detrimental to the conservatives.”
Rappold added that both sides – Berlin and Syriza – would have to work quickly to establish communication channels. “A poker game is starting where both sides will try to figure out where the common ground is and which demands each can hope for.”

Helena Smith picks out these snippets from Samaras’s speech.

“I assumed charge of a country that was on the brink of collapse … and we restored its international credibility.” 
“Mistakes were made and injustices occurred,” he said referring to the wave of budget cuts and tax rises that were ordered under his tenure. “But I hand over a country in better shape and my conscience is clear. I hope that my forecasts [of economic catastrophe] will not be materialised.”

He said his conscience was clear. “The elections result is not pleasant for us,” he said. But he pointed out that his party only lost two percentage points on the last election.

Not everyone in Germany is carping, writes Louis Osborne in Berlin.

Co-chairman of Germany’s Left Party Bernd Riexinger has congratulated Syriza on the results of the election saying it is clear it is a time for change, also in Germany. “In Germany we should also let it inspire us. We need in Germany not less, but more left-wing politics,” he said. 
Meanwhile, co-chairman of the Greens parliamentary group, Anton Hofreiter told the Rheinischen Post the party was in favour of a conditional haircut in return for social and economic reforms in Greece. “Together with the new Greek government, the EU and the German government should seek ways to give the people in Greece perspective again,” he said.

A GuardianWitness user in Greece has spoken of their elation and concerns after voting for Syriza. 


Elections in Greece

I voted for SYRIZA, the left-wing party that seems to be winning the elections in Greece. I am elated and worried at the same time. I am elated because the progressive political domain I traditionally belong in seems to be achieving a historical victory. On the other hand, I am worried because, despite Alexis Tsipras' declared intentions to fight against austerity, the conservative political forces in Europe seem irremovably positioned against that prospect.
What I can say with certainty, if you allow me to interpret the outcome of the elections in Greece, is that the Greek people definitely voted against the effort the memorandum-friendly elements -both domestic (current governing party and current P.M., Mr. Samaras) and foreign- made to intimidate them and 'manipulate' their voting by exercising terror on them, focusing on words like 'bankrupcy', 'destruction', 'horror' etc. If nothing else, the Greek people proved that they won't be intimitated and for that I am proud -no matter what happens henceforth.

There’s been more grumbling from Germany, according to Louise Osborne in Berlin. 

The head of Germany’s eurosceptic party Alternative für Deutschland, Bernd Lucke, has called for a haircut for Greece, although he said it must be accompanied with an exit from the euro, according to reports from the Berlin newspaper the Tagesspiegel.
“Syriza doesn’t question the euro, but demands further debt relief and more loans. That doesn’t fit together,” he said.
The chairman of the CDU/CSU group in the European parliament, Herbert Reul, called the idea of another haircut unthinkable. “Greece must continue with the course of reforms if it doesn’t want to risk a departure from the monetary union,” he said.

“I believe it’s also in the interest of the Greek government to do what is necessary to tackle the structural problems there,” Weidmann said. 
 He singled out administration, public finances and the economy as being particularly in need of reform. 
“I hope the new government won’t call into question what is expected and what has already been achieved,” he said.

 6.47pm GMT13:47 

Germany has insisted that Greece needs to stick with the austerity programme, whatever the result, writes Louise Osborne in Berlin.

Philipp Mißfelder, foreign policy spokesman for the ruling CDU/CSU parliamentary group, says there is a worry in Germany about a shift to populist movements in Europe that are “very bad for Europe and for the euro”. 
“This kind of protest is not a surprise, people are unhappy about the austerity measures, not only in Greece but also in countries like Italy. But I think Syriza shouldn’t expect Germany to renegotiate with the programmes. They have to stick with what the former government has promised,” he said.
However, he said that if Greek politicians did want to negotiate, they would have to do so with the troika. “We are not in a position to negotiate,” he said, adding that Germany did not want to risk a “Grexit” and would try to avoid it.
While a lot of people in Germany are worried about the current development, he added: “Germans trust the government and they trust Angela Merkel and believe she has done the right thing … It was always crystal clear that without political reforms, it would always be complicated and there is a lot of homework to do for all of Europe, but the euro is one of the greatest achievements we’ve had in Germany.”

The sniping from Europe’s elite has already begun.

Syriza in Greece has won the election by promising that taxpayers in other Euro counties will pay even more to them. Rather daring.

If the result is confirmed, Syriza would become the first anti-austerity party in government in Europe, AFP points out. 

A Syriza victory is likely to send shockwaves through the austerity-hit EU and spark fears that Greece could leave the euro. 
Syriza wants to renegotiate the terms of Greece’s €240bn bailout with the EU and the International Monetary Fund which the party says is stifling any chance Greece has of recovering from a six-year recession. 
“This appears to be a historic victory, a message that does not only concern the Greek people, it resounds all over Europe and brings relief,” Syriza party spokesman Panos Skourletis told Mega TV. 
The first official results of the third election in Greece in five years are expected at 7.30pm GMT. 
Thousands of Syriza supporters gathered around the party’s main campaign platform in a central Athens square to hail their leader. 
Antonis Balousis, a 54-year-old butcher, said: “This is a very important victory for Greece and Europe. 
“We are going to prove that a different kind of politics is possible in Europe.” 
Neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn and pro-European party To Potami are in a neck-and-neck race for third place with between 6.4% and 8% apiece, the exit polls showed. 
Projections showed that Syriza may win an absolute majority of up to 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament, meaning it could rule without a coalition partner.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that New Democracy – the dominant force in prime minister Antonis Samaras’ outgoing coalition – is haemorrhaging votes to Syriza, writes Helena Smith in Athens.

The pattern of voting looks to be following May’s European election, which saw Syriza topping the poll. 
Several Greeks have told the Guardian they would be switching vote. 
Sophia Tzeorgou, a retired shop keeper, emerged from a polling station in Athens saying for the first time ever she had embraced the leftists. 
“I am 66 and have voted New Democracy all my life, just as my mother and father did before me,” she said. 
“Now me, my husband and two daughters are all supporting Syriza. There is no other way. Those who have been holding power over us have to go. They have taken everything from us. There is nothing more to give.” She added that her family’s disposable income had dropped by about €1,000 a month because of taxes, cuts and loss of benefits.

The New Democracy party have demanded a judicial inquiry into leaked early exit polls that supposedly put Syriza as much as 12 or even 14 points ahead, according to the English website of the Kathimerini newspaper.
This does give the exit poll a little more credence, but it should still be treated with caution, according to Jon Henley in Athens. 
Some observers are getting excited.

Germany is bracing itself for the results, writes Louise Osborne in Berlin. 
The country’s biggest daily, Bild, claims Syriza no longer wants conditions to be dictated by Europe, and that therefore “all that remains for the Greeks is an exit from the eurozone and a return to the drachma”.
Earlier this month, leaks from the German government suggested that Berlin was relaxed about Greece leaving the euro. But the report was later denied.

Monitors representing Syriza in polling stations around Athens say they are very exited by unofficial exit polls that give the leftists a much bigger lead than thought, writes Helena Smith.

As the vote is still under way no one wants to go on the record – quite yet. But reports are being confirmed by analysts, who put the difference at as much as 12 percentage points (38-26) – an outcome that would likely give Alexis Tsipras’ Syriza party an outright majority in Athens’ 300-seat House.
Greece’s incumbent prime minister, Antonis Samaras, is apparently hunkered down in his office with top cadres from his conservative New Democracy party. The mood in the New Democracy camp according to the Greek media “is anything but good”.

 2.58pm GMT09:58 

Confused by how the Greek election system works? The Irate Greek explains a rule of thumb  over what percentage of the vote will be enough to secure a majority of the 300 parliamentary seats. It all depends on how many of the smaller parties reach the 3% threshold necessary to secure a seat. 

To determine the percentage of nationwide votes needed to secure a majority, you should deduct from 100% the percentage of valid votes obtained by parties who did not reach the 3% threshold and multiply the percentage left by 0.404.
If parties who did not reach the 3% threshold obtained 8.5% of all valid votes nationwide, the minimum percentage of votes needed to secure a majority in parliament is (100%-8.5%)*0.404 = 36.96%
In the 6 May 2012 elections, parties that did not reach the 3% threshold obtained 19.03% of votes. This means that a party with as little as 32.71% of votes would secure a majority in government. Following final results, the allocation of seats in parliament stands as follows: 
Nea Dimokratia (conservative): 18.85% of votes, 108 seatsSyriza (leftwing): 16.78% of votes, 52 seats
Pazok (socialist): 13.18% of votes, 41 seats Independent Greeks (populist nationalist right-wing): 10.60% of votes, 33 seats Communist Party: 8.48% of votes, 26 seatsGolden Dawn (neo-nazi): 6.97% of votes, 21 seatsDemocratic Left: 6.11% of votes, 19 seats

Reuters adds further explanation:

If all parties running get into parliament, the threshold for outright victory is just over 40%, but the majority drops depending on how many votes go to parties that fail to clear the 3% entry threshold  If, for example, 5% of the vote goes to parties that fail to get into parliament, the margin for victory could be around 38%.  If there is no outright winner, president Karolos Papoulias gives the leader of the biggest party a mandate to form a coalition or gain agreement for a minority government. Should this fail, the exploratory mandate is handed to the second party, and then to the third.  If the parties cannot agree, the president holds a final meeting with party leaders. If they still cannot agree, he appoints a caretaker government to call new elections.

 2.36pm GMT09:36 
Summary

Welcome to our live coverage of the final stages of an election that could have profound consequences for Greece and the future of Europe.
The main contest is between the frontrunner Syriza – the leftwing opposition party led by Alexis Tsipras, and the governing centre-right New Democracy party led by prime minister Antonis Samaras. 
The benchmark for a workable majority is around 37% of the vote. Under Greek election rules, the winning party automatically gets a bonus of 50 extra seats in the 300-seat parliament.
The polls are due to close at 5pm GMT (7pm local time). Exit polls are expected soon after and we should have a clear idea of the likely result by around 8pm GMT (10pm local time).
Syriza is expected to emerge as the victor, if numerous opinion polls are to be believed. But the key question is whether it will win enough seats to govern alone, or whether, as seems more likely, it will have to form a coalition with another party. Syriza has consistently led the polls with a three percentage point gap over the governing centre-right New Democracy party in the poll of polls. That gap widened in the latter stages of the short campaign, with polls last week giving Syriza leads of 6% and 6.5%. 



Syriza has insisted it does not want Greece to leave the euro, but it has also campaigned to write off half of Greece’s crippling €320bn debt, end austerity and the neoliberal economic reforms. Such conditions would be intolerable to the troika – the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – which agreed to a Greek bailout worth $240bn. So the election is likely to throw Greece into a collision with Europe and the banks. 
And if Greece was forced out of the euro, would other austerity-hit and debt-burdened European countries follow? 
Here’s some useful background reading:

The Guardian’s briefing on the Greek election.
The main parties: their positions, leaders and key policies.
The election has been conducted against a dismal economic backdrop and austerity programme that has left millions of Greek “sucked dry”, according to the Guardian’s Athens correspondent Helena Smith. She writes: The withering effects of such tumult cannot be underestimated. With unemployment rates unlikely to drop soon and 3 million living on, or below, the poverty line, there are few families who do not engage in some form of existential conversation about how they will survive.
Can the eurozone afford a Greek exit? There are fears that the binding that holds the eurozone together will be loosened, especially if Greece is allowed to default while remaining inside the zone, writes Phillip Inman.

After six years of recession – during which three centre-right coalitions failed to raise the country from its knees – young, unemployed, frustrated Greeks are looking for a new way out. Phoebe Greenwood meets Syriza and the young people voting for change:
