Job applicants wait for the opening of a job fair in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Sept. 17, 2012.  Three years of subpar growth have left the middle... View Enlarged ImageNow that the election is over, one thing is clear - the country will have to deal with several major problems that the mainstream media largely ignored to protect President Obama.
On issue after issue, in fact, the media didn't cover Obama's first term as much as they've covered up for him, whether it was the dismal state of the economy, the failure of his policies or the increased troubles abroad.
The effort worked remarkably well, helping to shield Obama from responsibility, protecting his image, providing a solid floor under his approval ratings, and ultimately a second term in the White House.
But now that Obama is safely in the White House for another four years, the press is sure to churn out what can charitably be called "now they tell us" stories about these matters, now that any potential election impact has passed.
On Tuesday, Yahoo News provided a glimpse, with a story by seasoned journalist Walter Shapiro, who finally got around to wondering whether "anyone outside (Obama's) family and the inner sanctum of the White House staff really know Obama or have a clear handle on what he would do with a second term."
That's the sort of question you'd expect the press to pursue in the weeks leading up to the election, when it might have helped voters make up their minds. But it's of little value after they've left for the polls.
Among other stories the media are likely to "discover" now that voters have made their decision:
 The economy really does stink. The press studiously ignored the ongoing economic catastrophe under Obama, while parading any "green shoot" they could find that suggested growth was around the corner.
Don't be surprised if, after the election, they start to notice that three years of subpar growth have left the middle class further behind and more mired in poverty, and created a vast pool of long-term unemployed.
 Massive debt and entitlement crises loom. Despite four straight years of $1 trillion-plus deficits and a national debt that now exceeds total GDP, the media largely treated the debt crisis with a collective yawn.
Ditto the looming bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security. These crises are nevertheless real and will have to be dealt with soon, a fact the press will almost certainly acknowledge after Nov. 6.
 The debt ceiling limit is fast approaching. Another story that went largely unremarked this campaign is the fact that the country is approaching the new debt ceiling limit. The Treasury Dept. warned last week that it expects the government to reach its borrowing limit before the end of the year.

Congress and the White House will have to deal with that just as they're trying to avoid the fiscal cliff.
 ObamaCare isn't what it was cracked up to be. After two years of ignoring health reform's fundamental flaws, the press will likely admit that ObamaCare is fundamentally flawed.
Reports are sure to appear pointing out the law's lack of cost controls, its adverse impact on doctors and hospitals, and the fact that, after spending $1.76 trillion, it will still leave 30 million uninsured.
 Obama's deficit-cutting plan won't work. The press let the president get away with one of the biggest whoppers yet — that his tax hikes on "the rich" would be enough to pay for his spending binge and bring down the deficit $4 trillion.
Obama's own budget proved this wasn't the case. And after the election, you can bet the media will be "shocked" to find that his numbers didn't add up.
 Questions about Benghazi still demand answers. After almost two full months spent burying the Benghazi story, expect the mainstream press to wake up and notice that, as the Washington Post admitted in an editorial last Friday, "a host of unanswered questions" remains.
So far, only Fox News has bothered to pursue this story, but we expect that other outlets will pick up on it after the elections.
We could go on. But you get the idea.
Note: This editorial has been updated to reflect the outcome of the presidential election.
