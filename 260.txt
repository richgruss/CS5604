[ELECTION 2015] Buhari’s campaign Organisation gets N54m boost

The presidential flag-bearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday said he has received N54 million from Nigerians in support of his campaign for the 2015 elections.
Mr. Buhari, who disclosed this during a news conference in Abuja, added that his support groups had risen to 82 with membership in all regions of the country.
“So far, Nigerians have donated N54,415, 000. 70 to support our campaign ahead of the 2015 presidential election and currently 82 support groups have been registered under the Buhari Support Organisations (BSO),” he said.



“The BSO has 475,796 coordinators and a total membership in the region of 8,492, 226 across the country.”
He thanked the donors for donating generously “to actualise our dreams and we intend to use the registration and donation cards to enlist the members of the groups as volunteer change agents”.
Mr. Buhari, however, warned that only the authorised account designated for the crowd-funding, which he is the sole signatory to, is the BSO account with First Bank Nigeria PLC.
“I know we live in difficult times. There is insecurity, corruption, poverty and above all the uncertainty of lives which is becoming unbearable.
“I want to appeal to our supporters to continue making sacrifice till we get the needed change,” he urged.
