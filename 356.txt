Elections in India

How intriguing and unpredictable an affair can the elections in India be, the just concluded Delhi legislative assembly elections are a perfect epitome of that. Who would have ever imagined that the biggest national party, BJP would suffer an embarrassing rout and the Congress would be annihilated to extinction? Well, this has turned out to be a reality, handing the “Aam Aadmi” the most special of the victories of them all.

The astounding verdict of Delhi resulted in the AAP grabbing 67 of the available 70 seats, which is a staggering 95.71 percent of seats won by the party. It is hard to believe for most of the people, that the same electorate that gifted the BJP all 7 parliamentary seats less than a year ago, squeezed them to a small corner with just three assembly seats. By the way, the moment belongs to the AAP and its chief Arvind Kejriwal, whose short stint of 49 days proved good enough to toss him up to the coveted throne of the chief minister of Delhi.

The AAP has the mandate it required, it has to deliver what Delhi deserves.

Right to Vote
The Constituent Assembly adopted the principle of universal adult franchise as the main method of democratic representation in the Lok Sabha and in the State Legislative Assemblies.

Election Process in India

In an election, various candidates of different parties contest against each other, out of which the people elect their representative. The stages of the election process of India include delimitation of constituencies wherein the entire area (the whole country in the case of Lok Sabha elections and that particular state in the case of Legislative Assembly elections) is divided into constituencies. After the demarcation of constituency, the voters' list of each constituency is prepared and published and nomination papers are filed by the candidates. Thereafter, nomination papers are scrutinised. The next stage is the campaign by all the candidates and the parties. The election campaign ends 48 hours before the polling. The last step is the counting of votes and declaration of result. 

Political Parties in India

A political party is a group of people who want to achieve common goals by contesting elections and exercising political power upon winning. India has a multi-party system. Some of the major political parties in India are: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress, Bahujan Samaj party (BSP), Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), National Congress Party (NCP), Janata Dal United (JDU) and Shiv Sena.
