G-MAN: DEMS Busted Hiring Thugs for Election 

After the first article linking Progressive PST & Neal Rauhauser to several, national Democrat Candidates – the findings were reported to The G-Man on his radio show dated October 4, 2010.
Previously being discussed on the G. Gordon Liddy show – live from DC – was the War on Terror and the nation’s so-called, “energy crisis.”
Listen to Conservative Report founder, Patrick Read discuss “Desperate Democrats Hire E-Thugs” with the G-Man.

This interview followed the article, “Enemy’s List” dated September 8, 2010. Subsequently, the DC Examiner ran the story and others are releasing unique versions of the investigative report, one medium at a time.
There is still a lot left to disclose regarding  the investigation on Neal Rauhauser, Beth A. Becker, Progressive PST & their associations, and deplorable tactics used to attack & defame American citizens associated with the Tea Party.
Here is a re-edited version of the original. It will serve as the base for further releases and disclosure.
Stay tuned for more Twittergate, and don’t miss a thing!
