After all the exit polls gave his party an outright majority, the pressure to win will all be on him. No wonder he's asking for prayers!All the very best Delhiites. Do pray. Prayers are v powerful.— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) February 10, 2015Kiran Bedi on the other hand is playing it cool. She's feeling more for the 'poor journalists' who are gathered outside her home. Ah well Ms Bedi, it is a thankless job but someone has got to do it!Another shot of scene of media outside my home right now. Poor media has been here much before day break.. pic.twitter.com/LArFSFPu6A— Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi) February 10, 20157:00 am: Will counting confirm 'paanch saal' of Kejriwal?In a matter of hours, we will finally know the outcome of the Delhi polls, capping a high pitched and extremely dramatic poll campaign that has seen cross overs, last minute surprises, allegations and counter allegations, and of course, tears.PTIFrom the emergence of Kiran Bedi as the surprise choice for the BJP's CM candidate, to the allegations of money laundering levelled against the Aam Aadmi Party by a splinter group calling itself AVAM, and ex-AAP leaders Shazia Ilmi and Vinod Kumar Binny crossing over to the BJP, this election has been almost a sound bite a minute.So how did the Delhi voter cut through the noise and actually choose someone? That's what we are set to find out sooner rather than later.All the exit polls so far seem to suggest that AAP, which had found itself down and out following a trouncing in the Lok Sabha polls and reeling from Kejriwal's disastrous decision to resign from the Chief Minister's post after 49 days in power in Delhi, has not only picked itself up, but may just be in a position to deliver the BJP a knockout punch.All save one exit poll, predicted that AAP would be able to form a government on its own. Here is a look at what they all say:Stunned by the word on the ground, the BJP has admitted that it needs to learn some important lessons from its performance in Delhi, but are still holding onto hope that they may yet be able to swing this one.This hope has been compounded by an internal review by state unit president Satish Upadhyay who spoke to leaders and said that the party was confident of winning at least 36 seats in the polls. This has however been shot down by the RSS, which after doing an internal survey of its own, said that BJP would most likely lose.As per the survey, out of the 70-seat Delhi assembly, the BJP is likely to get not more than 34 seats in the best case scenario. While the party will face defeat on 20 seats, it has a neck-and-neck fight with the Aam Aadmi Party in 16 constituencies, sources in the RSS told Firstpost.As indicated in the RSS survey, some constituencies are indeed too close to call, and if the BJP can swing some of these to its advantage, even by very slim margins, we could see the final outcome differing drastically from what was predicted in the exit polls.also seeDelhi exit polls 2015: It's unanimous, all polls say AAP has overcome Modi waveBJP goes all out on last day of campaigning: Will hold rallies in all 70 Delhi constituenciesLive: Even Narendra Modi sat on dharna when he was Gujarat CM, says KejriwalAAP in the meantime has also disagreed with the exit polls, saying that their own surveys predict a much bigger win for the party. Yogendra Yadav said AAP was most likely to wind up with 50-plus seats."This is based on exit poll figures, our pre-poll survey and a feel from the ground which I got after roaming the city on the day of election. In fact, I feel that exit polls have underestimated AAP's performance. Not only have they understated our vote share but they also seem to have been conservative in translating it into seats," he said in comments to the media.Congress meanwhile has squarely emerged as the 'also ran' in this contest. The exit polls indicate that the party faces the very real threat of being completely wiped out in the state.Congress general secretary Ajay Maken who was the face of the party in the election could resign from his post if he fails to win from the Sadar Bazar seat in the Delhi Assembly polls, sources said.more in DelhiSikh to Muslim voters: Here's which voter blocs will influence outcome in Delhi polls results 2015RSS contradicts BJP's internal survey, says the party won't get majorityNew Delhi to GK: Key battles to watch out for in Delhi election 2015 resultsFirst the exit polls, now the waiting: BJP is jittery but hopeful in Delhilatest postsPolygamy not integral to Islam, govt rule barring it doesn't violate Article 25: SC GDP may grow 7.4%: India matches China but numbers tell a different taleRohtak gangrape: The police ignored and India didn't outrage over poor Nepali victimWorld Cup warm-up: Battered India look for confidence boost against AfghanistanPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.
