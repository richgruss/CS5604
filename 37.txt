Japan- Allegations of General Election Fraud on Dec. 16, 2012 come to light!

THURSDAY, 17 JANUARY 2013
Source: Allegations of General Election Fraud on Dec. 16, 2012 in Japan



Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won the majority of votes though they only had 14% of the vote.  The new Government started on Dec. 26, 2012, and the media said one of the reasons why LDP won was that there were too many new parties that support a nuclear free society.
Therefore none of them got enough support from citizens who want a nuclear free society. However there have been so many reports from the general public through twitter and blogs on allegations of election rigging in the last one month.
Lots of voting places closed 1-4 hours earlier without any notice.  Normally in Japan about 60% of the population goes to vote but this time so many people said there were very long queues outside the building. 85% of the nation doesn’t want nuclear energy, yet none of the ｐｏｌｉｔｉｃａｌ parties that support a nuclear free society did not do well.  This does not sound right.

Furthermore one company called MUSASHI CO., LTD dealt with the whole election: from counting votes to publicity; there is speculation that this company has something to do with nuclear power.

Finally a written complaint of election fraud was submitted to the Tokyo High Court on Jan. 14th, 2013 and was accepted.  I hope justice will be done before next general election this summer.

UPDATE TO ARTICLE
23/1/13
 I posted this correction in my blog.
Correction: 14% to 16.4%  I would like to apologize that I didn’t explain well and got figure slightly wrong.  Here is what I wanted to say: Even LDP won the election but it didn’t have majority support from the nation.  You will find a good explanation in this Japanese blog:
http://uekusak.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2012/12/9-04db.html
Japanese media says LDP won the election by gaining 43% of votes and got 79% of legislative seats.  However it should say LDP won the election and got 73% of legislative seats by only getting 16.4% of all voters and 27.7% of proportional representation.
According to this blog:
LDP small electoral district 43%
voter turnout 59.3%
proportional representation　27.7% of the vote
No. of votes obtained 16350,000

This helps to explain why people would elect the pro nuke knuckleheads of the LDP. If true, but I don’t doubt it, surely, these people are as evil and corrupt as it gets. Also, as a professor from Sophia Univ. pointed out, the LDP led people to believe they were more ambivalent about nuclear power, but once elected went for the jugular and proclaimed they wanted all reactors restarted asap. Further, we have the infiltration of the anti nuke movement by pro nukers such as a professor from Takachiho University who guides anti nuke activists to “join hands with the LDP”! Har. Might as well join hands with the Devil Himself. Thank you for this important news item.

We sued the Japanese government (Election Committees).
The media never cover our lawsuits because they are corrupt and part of the fraud.
As long as I know, there are at least six parties, including us, who did the same; three to Tokyo High Court; one to Osaka; one to Fukuoka; and another one to Sendai High Court. 
We strongly believe there WAS such a large-scale, organizational electoral fraud that many Japanese voters feel or believe the election held last month was a big fake and fraud that we can never overlook. 
Please share and spread this news among as many people, website, or whatever, as possible because we need supports from overseas as well as domestic voters in Japan.

How is gender relevant for disarmament and arms control?……..there is a strong correlation between carrying guns and notions of masculinity. Inside and outside of armed conflict, so-called “gun culture” is overwhelmingly associated with cultural norms of masculinity, including men as protectors and as warriors.
Nuclear weapons likewise afford a sense of masculine strength. Possessing and brandishing an extraordinarily destructive capacity is a form of dominance associated with masculine warriors (nuclear weapons possessors are sometimes referred to as the “big boys”). After India’s 1998 nuclear weapon tests a Hindu nationalist leader explained, “We had to prove that we are not eunuchs.” When governments act as though their power and security can only be guaranteed by a nuclear arsenal, they create a context in which nuclear weapons become the ultimate necessity for, and symbol of, state security. And when nuclear-armed states then work hard to ensure that other countries do not obtain nuclear weapons, they are perceived as subordinating and emasculating others.
Highlighting the ways in which the possession and proliferation of weapons are underwritten and supported by a particular construction of masculinity enable us to see just how dangerous and illusory an image of security weapons produce. ……

Gender-based violence it is vitally important for states, international organizations, and civil society to explore and understand how gender constructions affect armament and disarmament policies and budgets. Much work is needed on this subject….http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/resources/fact-sheets/critical-issues/4741-gender-and-disarmament http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/resources/fact-sheets/critical-issues/4741-gender-and-disarmament
 

Steven Starr 
  Nuclear war has no winner……nuclear firestorms would produce millions of tons of smoke, which would rise above cloud level and form a global stratospheric smoke layer that would rapidly encircle the Earth. The smoke layer would remain for at least a decade, and it would act to destroy the protective ozone layer (vastly increasing the UV-B reaching Earth[vii]) as well as block warming sunlight, thus creating Ice Age weather conditions that would last 10 years or longer.
Following a US-Russian nuclear war, temperatures in the central US and Eurasia would fall below freezing every day for one to three years; the intense cold would completely eliminate growing seasons for a decade or longer. No crops could be grown, leading to a famine that would kill most humans and large animal populations.
Electromagnetic pulse from high-altitude nuclear detonations would destroy the integrated circuits in all modern electronic devices[viii], including those in commercial nuclear power plants. Every nuclear reactor would almost instantly meltdown; every nuclear spent fuel pool (which contain many times more radioactivity than found in the reactors) would boil-off, releasing vast amounts of long-lived radioactivity. The fallout would make most of the US and Europe uninhabitable. Of course, the survivors of the nuclear war would be starving to death anyway.
Once nuclear weapons were introduced into a US-Russian conflict, there would be little chance that a nuclear holocaust could be avoided. Theories of “limited nuclear war” and “nuclear de-escalation” are unrealistic…….Yet top political leaders and policymakers of both the US and Russia seem to be unaware that their launch-ready nuclear weapons represent a self-destruct mechanism for the human race…..
It is frightening that President Obama and his administration appear unaware that the world’s leading scientists have for years predicted that a nuclear war fought with the US and/or Russian strategic nuclear arsenal means the end of human history. Do they not know of the existential threat these arsenals pose to the human race . . . or do they choose to remain silent because this fact doesn’t fit into their official narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats that could destroy a city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human extinction from nuclear war is never mentioned – even when the US and Russia are each running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a US-Russian war…….
The need is dire for the president of the US, Russia, or China to state in a highly public forum that the existence of nuclear weapons creates the possibility of their use and that their use in war would likely mean human extinction. As nuclear war has no winners, the weapons should be banned and destroyed before they destroy all of us. http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-lethality-of-nuclear-weapons-nuclear-war-has-no-winner/5385611

 Until nuclear dismantlement policies are reformed, disposal of unneeded nuclear weapons and their components will continue to be an afterthought, with huge costs looming in the future. Without reform, dismantlement will remain a mismanaged process kept in the shadows, except when it is burnished for display at NPT review conferences http://thebulletin.org/2014/november/nuclear-weapons-dismantlement-problem7791.
Hans Kristensen  (pic) Several commentators have argued that Russia’s aggression in Eastern Ukraine is evidence that the weapons are needed now more than ever. However, the evidence suggests the opposite: US tactical nuclear weapons detract from more useful defense initiatives, as is shown in several ways.
First, there is no evidence that these weapons have had any effect on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s transgressions in Ukraine, Georgia, or the Baltic States. ……….The newer NATO members closest to Russia are more concerned than ever and look to the West’s non-nuclear forces instead for support. The reason tactical nuclear weapons are irrelevant in these cases is simple: The threat to NATO territory is not nearly severe enough for nuclear weapons to play a role.
Also, leaders meeting at Cardiff should not ignore the consistent calls from NATO allies that host tactical nukes for their withdrawal. ……. Tactical nuclear bombs in Europe are no longer useful for defense, deterrence, or assurance. Calls to retain such weapons in Europe are an echo from the past rather than a solution for the future. http://thebulletin.org/why-nato-should-eliminate-its-tactical-nukes-despite-russian-belligerence7415
 
and – not forgetting  – the world’s best informed and most effective voice for a nuclear-free planet 
Dr Helen Caldicott
 “A small nuclear war between India and Pakistan using only 100 nuclear weapons the size of Hiroshima would create what’s called ‘nuclear autumn’. There would be so much dust and oil deposits and radioactive fallout shot up into the stratosphere – it would cause a very big fall in temperature and over a billion people would starve the crops would fail, over a number of years. And that’s only 100 weapons.”
From Alex Smith at http://www.ecoshock.info/   “Here is my reading list from Helen’s seven books that I think you should read. You could start with the latest book she edited: “Crisis Without End: The Medical and Ecological Consequences of the Fukushima Nuclear Catastrophe“. That was just published in October 2014. But I also recommend “War in Heaven: The Arms Race in Outer Space” written with Craig Eisendrath, and of course her classic book “Nuclear Power Is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else.””
