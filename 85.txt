 This is an informative thread that can be linked to news sites, Facebook, Twitter, etc.....anywhere you encounter someone trying to claim that election fraud doesn't exist and there is no need for laws to deal with the problem. Here's the shortened URL you can use on Twitter, etc.: http://tinyurl.com/n8j3xe3Where There's Smoke, There's Fire: 100,000 Stolen Votes in ChicagoBy Hans A. von SpakovskyWhere Chairman Mao believed that all power comes from the barrel of the gun, the late Mayor Richard J. Daley believed that all power comes from the barrel into which precinct totals have been tossed. - David Nyhan,The Boston Globe, December 16, 1982Chicago is known for its fires, and there was a roaring one there in 1982 that resulted in one of the largest voter fraud prosecutions ever conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice. The telltale smoke arose out of one of the closest governor's races in Illi­nois history; and as for the fire, the U.S. Attorney in Chicago at the time, Daniel Webb, estimated that at least 100,000 fraudulent votes (10 percent of all votes in the city) had been cast.[2]Sixty-five individuals were indicted for federal election crimes, and all but two (one found incompetent to stand trial and another who died) were convicted. [3]This case of voter fraud is worth studying be­cause it illustrates the techniques that political machines and organized political activist groups still use to steal elections today. Even in the present day, this threat is not hypothetical: Tactics similar to those documented in the Chicago case have come to light in recent elections in Philadel­phia and in the important "swing" states of Wisconsin and Tennessee, and across the U.S. The Daley machine may be legendary in modern times for its election fraud prowess, but these recent cases show that the incentives and opportunities for fraud have not lessened. Guarding against these tac­tics can make the difference between a fair election and a stolen election, particularly where the mar­gins of victory are narrow and just a few fraudulent votes can change the outcome.BackgroundIn 1982, Illinois was the setting for "a hotly con­tested" gubernatorial race between Democratic Senator Adlai Stevenson III, son of former governor and presidential hopeful Adlai Stevenson II, and Republican James Thompson.[4] "Big Jim" Thomp­son, the incumbent, was "a 15-point favorite going into the voting";[5] and yet on election day, Adlai Stevenson came within 5,074 votes of capturing the governorship out of 3.67 million votes cast statewide-a 0.14 percent margin.[6] Stevenson had carried Chicago by 3 to 1, with a winning margin of 469,000 votes, although Thompson won 60 percent of the vote in the rest of the state.[7]After the results were in, Stevenson immediately filed suit, contesting the results of the election and asking for a recount. He conceded defeat only when the Illinois Supreme Court two months later rejected his request for a statewide recount.[8]Stevenson claimed there was evidence of voter fraud in areas of the state outside of Chicago. Although those claims "did not pan out," it was clear that "the prospect of a close [judicial] look at the conduct of voting in Chicago did not please many of Chicago's Democratic kingpins, already under pressure because of the federal [criminal] investigation of charges of vote fraud in the [1982] election.…" For that reason, "many committeemen privately had expressed a hope that Stevenson would lose his bid for a recount."[9]Both campaigns had complained to the FBI, but the federal investigation was really sparked by a party worker from Chicago's 39th Ward who was upset by his precinct captain's broken promise to award him a city job for his participation in the vote fraud. The worker told a Chicago newspaper, and then the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office, "what he knew about vote fraud in that precinct."[10]Good reporting by the local media helped fuel the investigation. One wire story concerned "a man listed as voting at a Skid Row precinct in the 27th Ward [who] had been dead for more than two years." He was listed as living at the Arcade Hotel, and his signature was among those of 47 other voters listed as living at the hotel. However, the "[o]perators and residents of the hotel told the Sun-Times that 41 of the 47 people did not reside at the Arcade."[11]In its reporting, the Chicago Tribune discovered that the supposed home address of three voters in the 17th Precinct of the 27th Ward was a vacant lot. The paper also discovered that votes had been cast for seven residents of a nursing home who denied having voted-their signatures on the ballot applications were all forgeries. In fact, one resident had no fingers or thumbs with which to write a sig­nature.[12] The fraud was so blatant that the resident without fingers or thumbs "was counted as having voted twice by the end of the day."[13] Not surpris­ingly, Stevenson easily won the 17th Precinct, by a margin of 282 to 30.[14]These stories illustrated what was to be a recur­ring theme in the grand jury investigation: the theft of identities and the casting of fraudulent votes on behalf of dead voters, prison inmates, and people who had moved, as well as forged ballots cast on behalf of the elderly and the handicapped. Even fictitious voters were invented and ballots cast in their names.Grand Jury FindingsOn December 14, 1984, Chief Judge Frank Mc­Garr of the U.S. District Court for the Northern Dis­trict of Illinois publicly released the federal grand jury's report on the 1982 election-only the third time in the history of the court that a grand jury report had been made public.[15] The evidence re­vealed substantial vote fraud in Chicago during the November 2, 1982, election and found "that similar fraudulent activities have occurred prior to 1982."[16]What particularly struck FBI agent Ernest Locker was how routine vote fraud was for the pre­cinct captains, election judges, poll watchers, and political party workers he interviewed. They had been taught how to steal votes (and elections) by their predecessors, who had in turn been taught by their predecessors. Based on his investigation, Locker came to believe the claims, hotly debated among historians, that Mayor Daley threw the 1960 presidential election for John Kennedy with massive ballot stuffing in Chicago.[17] This type of voter fraud, stated Locker, "was an accepted way of life in Chicago."[18]Soon after the investigation started, it became evident that this was not a case of isolated wrongdo­ing, but rather a case of extensive, substantial, and widespread fraud in precincts and wards through­out Chicago. The FBI investigators concluded that their regular tools-interviewing witnesses, obtain­ing documents, and using handwriting experts to analyze signatures on documents-would not be up to the task. After all, to conduct a complete investigation, they would have to review "virtually all of the 1,000,000 ballot applications submitted in the City of Chicago in the November election" as well as the voter lists maintained by the election board for all of Chicago's 2,910 precincts (compris­ing approximately 1.6 million voters) to check for the names of voters registered in more than one pre­cinct, as well as registered voters who were dead.[19]So the FBI employed a new and unique tool in vote fraud investigation: a computer. Because this had never been done before, the FBI had to write a computer program that would match data between the list of registered voters, the list of individuals who had voted, and other databases. To that end, the FBI and federal prosecutors obtained death records from the Bureau of Vital Statistics; local, state, and federal prison records; the national Social Security list; Immigration and Naturalization Service records on aliens; driver's license records; and even utility (gas, electric, water, and telephone) records.[20]Locker was shocked at the sheer magnitude of the number of fraudulent votes and the fact that fraud occurred in every single Chicago precinct.[21] More than 3,000 votes had been cast in the names of individuals who were dead, and more than 31,000 individuals had voted twice in different locations in the city.[22]Thousands of individuals had supposedly voted despite being incarcerated at the time of the election, and utility records showed that some individuals who voted were registered as living on vacant lots.Armed with that information, Locker did some­thing unprecedented: He convinced his supervisors to dedicate all of the agents in the FBI field office in Chicago for an entire week to nothing but review­ing all of Chicago's voter registration cards and bal­lot applications.[23] So many signature comparisons were needed that the FBI flew in handwriting experts from its headquarters in Washington.[24] The Justice Department and the FBI have never concentrated that much manpower and resources, before or since, on investigating a voter fraud case.Teams of FBI agents were paired with Assistant United States Attorneys and assigned to investigate specific precincts, locating and talking to voters who had supposedly cast votes in the polling place.[25]They quickly learned that voters' signatures on ballot applications "had been forged wholesale in many precincts."[26] The investigation also "revealed that there were an extremely large number of tran­sients, incapacitated people, and senior citizens in whose names votes had been fraudulently cast" when they did not themselves vote.[27]The investigation uncovered a variety of voter-fraud techniques.Preying on the Disabled and Elderly. The evi­dence showed that the conspirators evaded detec­tion by casting ballots for those persons who would be the most unlikely to challenge the theft of their franchise. In the Seventh Circuit's Olinger decision, for example, the court described how the votes of elderly and handicapped voters who lived at a residential facility were stolen in a special absen­tee election:Hicks [the Democratic Party precinct captain] told the election judges that the residents of Monroe Pavillion were "crazy." He instructed appellant and the other election judges to ignore the wishes of the residents. Instead, the election judges were told to "punch 10" on the computerized ballot for every resident. Punching 10 on the ballot resulted in a vote for each of the Democratic candidates on the ballot. On October 30, 1982, appellant and the other election judges, with Hicks in attendance, conducted the special election at Monroe Pavillion. In over two hours of voting, approximately 52 residents voted. Appellant and the other election judges cast nearly all of those votes for the straight Democratic Party ticket by punching 10.[28]As described in the Olinger decision, votes of the elderly and disabled were regularly stolen at the residences where they lived. Their wishes were ignored, and the judges of election, under instructions from the precinct captain, punched a straight Democratic ticket. Most significantly, several Assistant State's Attorneys served as elec­tion observers but did not detect the fraud because they "believed it was the job of the judges of election to assist the voters and accu­rately register their choices for candidates." They failed to realize, however, that these "assistors" were actually ignoring the voters' preferences.[29]Impersonating Absent Voters. The dominant form of vote fraud was accomplished with ballots cast for absent voters.[30] The fraud often began with the legally required canvasses conducted in many precincts prior to the election:Although the canvass disclosed that a number of persons who were registered to vote in the precinct had died, moved away, or for some other reason had become ineligible to vote, these persons were not struck from the list of eligible voters. Finally on election day the defendants, either personally or by acting through others, caused numerous false ballots to be cast for the straight Democratic ticket.[31]On the day of the general election, dishonest precinct captains kept careful track of who came to the polls to vote. Runners working for the precinct captains not only supplied rides for voters, but also noted "who would not be coming to the polls because they were too sick, were too drunk, had recently moved away, or had died."Precinct captains supplied the names of those absent voters to other participants in the fraud, and "ballots either were punched on the voting machines by people posing as the voter, or were punched with ball point pens or other similar objects in a private place outside the polling areas by the precinct captain or his workers."[32] Some of the defendants even "went into washrooms, where they practiced forging the signatures" of those whom they believed would not vote.[33]Registering Aliens. Aliens who were illegally registered were another source of potential votes "for the unscrupulous precinct captain." The grand jury found that many aliens "register to vote so that they can obtain documents identifying them as U.S. citizens" and had "used their voters' cards to obtain a myriad of benefits, from social security to jobs with the Defense Department."[34] In fact, three aliens were charged "with attempting to get U.S. passports by using their voter registration cards."[35]U.S. Attorney Dan Webb estimated that 80,000 illegal aliens were registered to vote in Chicago.[36] Dozens of aliens were indicted and convicted for registering and voting,[37] and one individual was indicted for recruiting an illegal alien to register to vote.[38]False Registrations. Another way to obtain names that could be voted on election day was to have people falsely register to vote in a precinct. One party precinct captain, for example, had two city workers who were seeking to transfer their job locations register in his precinct even though they did not live there. Even the assistant precinct captain was falsely registered.[39] In some instances, the conspirators asked actual residents at the addresses where voters falsely claimed to reside to "place name-tags on their doors that bore the names of the non-resident registrants."[40]Other canvassers were indicted and charged with certi­fying the addresses of voters when no such address existed.[41]Casting Fraudulent Absentee Ballots. Precinct captains would ask their workers "to encourage voters to apply for absentee ballots whether or not they had a valid reason to do so and to turn the blank ballots over" so that the captains could vote the ballots. One worker noticed that two of the absentee ballots he delivered to a precinct captain had already been filled out: One "was straight Democratic, but…the other contained some Republican entries. The precinct captain caused the second absentee ballot containing Republican entries to be torn up."[42]Buying Votes. The going rate for a vote in one particular Chicago ward was two dollars, and some precinct captains kept a supply of dollar bills ready on election day solely for buying votes. Alcohol was also used as an incentive to get people to the polls, with one hotel manager ordering "the liquor in advance from the precinct captain."[43]Altering the Vote Count. Changing the actual vote count was another method of fraud. For example, one precinct captain and his son held their own fraudulent election after the polls closed by repeatedly running two ballots through the voting machine. At that time, Chicago was using punch cards for ballots, and punch card counting machines in the precincts totaled the votes cast (similar to the way optical-scan paper ballots are totaled today by computer scanners in the precincts). One ballot was a straight Demo­cratic "punch 10," and the precinct captain ran it through the counting machine 198 times. In order to avoid suspicion, he also ran a ballot con­taining some Republican votes through the machine six times.[44] All of the votes in that pre­cinct were fraudulent except for those two origi­nal ballots.[45]Lessons Learned:Three factors, in particular, contributed to the successful electoral fraud of former Mayor Daley's political machine.Interference by Party Officials.Precinct cap­tains in Chicago did not work for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners. They were polit­ical appointees of the ward committeemen and therefore answered only to the committeemen and their political party. A precinct captain's loyalty was not to running a clean and fair election but to the political party that controlled his ward. Despite not working for the election board, precinct captains often opened and supervised the polls on election day and directed or influenced the door-to-door canvasses "required by law in order to determine the accuracy of voter registration."[46]Because the election board approved all of the individuals submitted by the precinct captains and their political party to serve as official election judges, the precinct captains controlled the polling places even though it was the election judges who were legally responsible for the administration of each polling place. This patronage system tied the administration of elections into the political system that ran the city and dispensed jobs. This structure, in turn, created the means and the incentive to "steal votes on Election Day."[47]Lack of a Bipartisan Election System. Chicago witnessed the complete failure of its "bipartisan system [that] is meant to protect the election pro­cess from vote fraud."[48] This system assumes that there are two active political parties, each watching the other and overseeing all activities that occur during the election process, from voter registration to the administration of polling places on election day, to ensure that the law is followed and no fraud occurs.For example, the canvasses that occurred before the election to check the accuracy of the voter reg­istration list would provide "the intended biparti­san checks and balances only if it is conducted by two people representing opposite parties."[49] But in Chicago, the Republican Party was not strong enough in many sections of the city to function as a counterbalance to the Democratic Party. As a result, Chicago's voter registration list did not receive bipartisan scrutiny and contained many ineligible persons, including voters who had moved, were deceased, were not U.S. citizens, did not reside where they were registered, or were registered in more than one location.Similarly, there were supposed to be both Demo­cratic and Republican judges of election in the Chi­cago polling places, but many of the "Republican" slots were actually filled by Democrats masquer­ading as Republicans who had been chosen by the Democratic precinct captains. As a result, the "Republican" canvassers and election judges actu­ally assisted their Democratic counterparts in com­mitting fraud.[50]Biased or Inexperienced Poll Watchers. Poll watchers are intended to be the guardians of a clean election "by participating as critical observ­ers."[51] A well-trained and vigilant poll watcher should have been able to spot some of the types of voter fraud that occurred in the polling places in the 1982 Chicago election. However, many of the poll watchers in the worst Chicago precincts were individuals who had been appointed by precinct captains and were often part of the voter fraud con­spiracy, even helping to cast fraudulent ballots.There were also truly neutral poll watchers in Chi­cago during that election, but their lack of training and their inexperience in conducting elections allowed fraud to go on without detection. In one par­ticular precinct where a legitimate poll watcher was present the entire day, the grand jury found that:Quote:The precinct captain passed slips of paper to a cooperating judge of election who filled out ballot applications when the pollwatcher was not observing her. Various precinct workers surreptitiously went through the line multiple times. Ballots were punched outside of the polling area.[52]The grand jury commented that the subsequent mayoral election in 1983 appeared to have occurred without substantial evidence of voter fraud and that each of the "candidate[s] had a squadron of poll watchers who observed polling place activities with an eagle eye."[53] Of course, that mayoral election may also have been free of fraud because U.S. Attor­ney Dan Webb enlisted U.S. marshals, agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, FBI agents, and more than 80 Assistant U.S. Attorneys to "patrol polling places and investigate vote fraud complaints on Election Day."[54]According to one of the federal prosecutors in the case, the major reason that Harold Washington was elected the first black mayor of Chicago in 1983 was because the Daley machine's grip on the elec­toral process was broken by the federal prosecu­tions stemming from the grand jury investigation.[55]Grand Jury RecommendationsIn commenting on the voter fraud that occurred in Chicago, the grand jury expressed its disgust at "the flagrant disregard for our democratic system which is the hallmark of this crime." It was "shocked and dismayed at the boldness and the cavalier attitude with which these offenses have been carried out." It urged all citizens to watch for vote fraud and report irregular activities in their polling places and to "step forward and participate in the election process by becoming precinct cap­tains, judges of election, and pollwatchers." [56]To reduce the incidence of voter fraud, the grand jury made three concrete recommendations:Sever the relationship between party precinct captains and election judges. Judges hired by the election board to conduct canvasses and administer polling places on election day should be paid professionals whose loyalty and responsibility are to the election board, not to the local political party or elected city officials.Require all voters to provide a thumbprint when registering and when voting. Voters would place a thumbprint on a small pretreated box on the ballot application (not the ballot itself) when they vote. According to the grand jury, this was the only way to counter the wide­spread forgery of voters' signatures that occurred in this voter fraud conspiracy. The grand jury pointed out the virtues of this protection:No fingerprint would be placed on the actual ballot; therefore, the ballot would still be totally secret as it is now. The voter would not be required to put his finger in ink in order to register his print. The process is totally clean and is not intrusive. Many banks already use this identifying process on check cashing cards to verify the identity of the card user.Requiring a print on every ballot applica­tion would be a tremendous deterrent to vote fraud and no more of an invasion of privacy than a handwritten signature. It is impossible to forge a print. Finger­print experts cannot be fooled. If the pre­cinct captain voted for absent voters using the prints of paid volunteers, for example, the print of the absent voter could be compared with the print on the ballot application. If people in the poll­ing place participated in the fraud by placing their prints in the boxes, they would be readily identifiable.[57]The advantages of this system are obvious, particularly since it would eliminate the diffi­culty of trying to determine who forged a sig­nature and thus cast a fraudulent ballot on election day or a fraudulent absentee ballot through the mail.Void ballots after counting them. In the Chi­cago fraud, ballot outcomes were altered by running the same Democratic punch card ballot through a precinct tally machine multiple times. The grand jury suggested that counting machines be altered to "irrevocably mark each counted ballot" to prevent it from being run through the machine again.Although most jurisdictions have moved away from punch card voting machines since the 2000 presidential election, the paper ballots and pre­cinct-based optical scanners used in many states today are subject to the same type of abuse.National ImplicationsThe Chicago voter-fraud conspiracy and the grand jury's report on it offer lessons that are rele­vant today in understanding how voter fraud works and how to combat it effectively.Partisan Election Boards. The importance of a truly bipartisan system of checks and balances in which members of both major political parties (and minor parties to the extent that they have available membership) have representatives at every polling place is key to guaranteeing the integrity of elections. Equal representation on the boards of elections that oversee the administration of elections is just as important. In a 1993 case in Philadelphia, for exam­ple, Democratic members of the county board of elections "applied the election code in a discrimina­tory manner designed to favor one candidate."[58]Unfortunately, there are still many jurisdic­tions-particularly large cities like Philadelphia- that are controlled by one political party and have too few members of the other party involved in the administration of elections. Transparency, as accomplished by bipartisan oversight and the work of well-trained election observers, is the hallmark of election integrity.Voter Misidentification. While the grand jury's thumbprint recommendation has not been adopted in the United States, it has shown great success in reducing voter fraud in Mexico:To obtain voter credentials, the citizen must present a photo, write a signature and give a thumbprint. The voter card includes a picture with a hologram covering it, a magnetic strip and a serial number to guard against tampering. To cast a ballot, voters must present the card and be certified by a thumbprint scanner. This system was instrumental in allowing the 2000 election of Vicente Fox, the first opposition party candidate to be elected president in seventy years.[59]This system was essential to stopping the mas­sive voter fraud that had occurred in Mexico's elec­tions for much of its history. Whether such a requirement could overcome civil liberties and pri­vacy concerns in America is uncertain; however, such a requirement combined with a photo ID would eliminate many forms of voter fraud that continue to occur across the country.Unreliable Registration Lists. The Chicago voter fraud also demonstrates the importance of maintain­ing voter registration lists by regularly deleting the names of voters who have died or moved away. Otherwise, the lists will contain a large pool of names that can be used to steal an election by the casting of fraudulent votes. Many states, such as Indiana and Missouri, have neglected the mainte­nance of their voter registration lists for years.For the first decade that the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) was in effect, the Justice Department never filed a single enforcement action against any state for failing to maintain its list and purge ineligible voters. Recent lawsuits by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice against jurisdictions that had failed to purge ineligible vot­ers as required by the NVRA have been sharply criticized as attempts to "disenfranchise" voters.[60]New technology and readily available Internet databases could resolve another persistent problem found by the grand jury in 1982 that still exists in registration lists all over the country today: phony voter registration addresses. Election jurisdictions do not routinely run comparisons between their voter registration lists and the information that is available in tax or utility records or through geolo­cation services such as Google Earth.As was demonstrated by the FBI in the Chicago case, such data matching can quickly turn up registration addresses that are vacant lots or busi­nesses-evidence of possible registration fraud. Similarly, if 100 individuals are registered at an address that is a single-family residence, that is clear evidence of fraud. The techniques devel­oped by the FBI in 1982 should be incorporated into the processes used by states today to verify the accuracy of the information in their voter reg­istration lists.Recent cases in Wisconsin and Tennessee show that the tactics used in Chicago to steal votes have not been forgotten and are still in use today, despite the election "reforms" of recent years.In Wisconsin-a state that John Kerry won by only 11,000 votes-the technique of running com­parisons between the voter registration list and other databases was employed in a 2004 investiga­tion of possible voter fraud in Milwaukee.[61] The Milwaukee Police Department's Special Investiga­tions Unit, working with the U.S. Attorney's Office, the local district attorney, and the FBI, used Google databases, motor vehicle records, telephone direc­tories, Assessor's Office records, and U.S. Postal Service records to investigate allegations of voter fraud. They uncovered a variety of problems:5,217 "students" who were registered to vote at a polling place located within the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who listed as their resi­dence an on-campus dormitory that housed only 2,600 students;At least 220 ineligible felons who had voted;370 addresses that were not legal residences in the city;Residents of other states (such as voters from Chicago) who registered and voted in Milwaukee;Numerous staffers from out of state who were working for the Kerry campaign or the Environ­mental Victory Campaign, a Democratic political action committee, and who illegally registered and voted in Milwaukee; andHundreds of homeless individuals registered as living at office buildings, at store fronts, and in multiple locations who were "able to vote in different districts and, by sheer number, could have an impact on a closely contested local election."[62]In Tennessee, a state senate race in 2005 that was decided by only 13 votes led to the expulsion of the winner from the legislature after it was found that votes had been cast by individuals who were dead at the time of the election, felons whose vot­ing rights had not been restored, voters whose resi­dences were vacant lots, and voters who actually lived outside of the district. Three election workers in one precinct were convicted of 12 felonies for faking votes by making false entries on election documents and other misconduct, including forg­ing the signatures of deceased voters on ballot forms and falsely certifying vote totals.[63]These election workers engaged in the same type of fraud that was used in Chicago in 1982, and, again, this fraud could have been avoided if deceased voters had been deleted from the registra­tion lists and registration addresses had been checked. Having bipartisan election workers and poll watchers in the polling place might have also prevented such actions.ConclusionVoter fraud in Chicago, in just one election, led to 100,000 phony votes,[64]bringing the defendants in this case within 5,000 votes of stealing the gov­ernorship of Illinois. This case of widespread fraud was broken wide open only because of the failed promise of a city job to one of the participants and the dogged determination of a United States Attor­ney who was willing to commit the time, resources, and manpower required for a massive investigation and multiple prosecutions. The Justice Department has never engaged in such an intense investigation since then, to the detriment of the electoral system.We will never know whether, when Mayor Daley was still alive and in full control of Chicago's elec­tion machinery, he manufactured the 8,858 votes that won Illinois for John Kennedy in 1960.[65] The 1984 grand jury report certainly shows that it could easily have been done, and the fact that the indicted defendants told investigators that their predecessors had taught them how to commit fraud makes it seem likely. As retired FBI agent Ernest Locker, Jr., observed, massive voter fraud was a way of life for the city's political machine and shows that "what happens in a small area can sometimes change history."[66]Worth quoting in full is the final comment of the Chicago grand jury's report on its voter fraud investigation:Quote:Every vote that is fraudulently manufac­tured disenfranchises the legitimate voter and makes a mockery of our political pro­cess. Vote fraud is like a cancer, and it must be treated so that it will not destroy our con­stitutional right to vote, the basis of our American heritage.[67]That observation is no less true today than it was in 1982.

The above article is JUST regarding Chicago in 1982. There is proof that 100,000 fraudulent Democrat votes were cast in that ONE election in that ONE city. Imagine how MILLIONS of such fraudulent votes are being perpetrated by radical groups all over the U.S. using precisely the same tactics.Anyone who really believes that Democrats fight tooth-and-nail against voter ID laws because they're concerned that a handful of voters might be "disenfranchised", I'd like to talk to you about a once in a lifetime deal I have for you on some prime beachfront property in Arizona.

‘Imaginary’ voter fraud caught on real, ‘non-imaginary’ videoBy Rusty Weiss on November 2, 2014While liberals continue to insist that there is no evidence of voter fraud in our elections, video evidence continues to refute their claims.MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow writes, “The scourge of voter fraud is largely imaginary.”With that, a new video has surfaced which shows campaign officials in North Carolina encouraging non-citizens to vote for Democrat Kay Hagan. In doing so, they’ve committed a felony.Conservative journalist James O’Keefe and his group, Project Veritas, have captured video evidence of the “imaginary” felonious voter fraud being perpetrated by campaign workers.The YouTube description reads:A stunning undercover video exposes a reckless disregard of election law in North Carolina. Multiple campaign operatives and workers, both Democrats and Republicans, encourage felony voter fraud.At one point during a conversation with a campaign worker, a person posing as a Brazilian-born illegal states that “I have a little secret,” and explains that she is an undocumented immigrant. She then asks the campaign worker about her voting status, to which the campaign worker says, “Yeah, you can vote.”In another scene, a man explains to a campaign manager for Democrat Irwin Carmichael – who is running for Sheriff – that technically her voter registration is not legal, but that she really wants to support Kay Hagan.In fact, at one point the woman says “I don’t want to vote if I’m not legal.”To which the campaign manager responds, “It shouldn’t be an issue at all.”

Was Nixon Robbed?By David Greenberg"You gotta swallow this one," says a Republican hack in Oliver Stone's Nixon, referring to the 1960 election, in which John F. Kennedy prevailed. "They stole it fair and square."That Richard Nixon was cheated out of the presidency in 1960 has become almost an accepted fact. You've probably heard the allegations: Kennedy's operatives fixed the tallies in Texas and Illinois, giving him those states' 51 electoral votes and a majority in the Electoral College. Fearing that to question the results would harm the country, Nixon checked his pride and declined to mount a challenge.The story is rich in irony: The much-hated Nixon, later driven from the presidency for cheating in an election, puts country before personal gain. The beloved Kennedy, waltzing through life, pulls off the political crime of the century. Nixon's defenders like the story because it diminishes Watergate. His detractors like it since it allows them to appear less than knee-jerk—magnanimously crediting Nixon with noble behavior while eluding charges of Kennedy worship.The race was indeed close—the closest of the century. Kennedy received only 113,000 votes more than Nixon out of the 68 million ballots cast. His 303-219 electoral-vote margin obscured the fact that many states besides Texas and Illinois could have gone either way. California's 32 electoral votes, for example, originally fell into Kennedy's column, but Nixon claimed them on Nov. 17 after absentee ballots were added.Even before Election Day, rumors circulated about fraud, especially in Chicago, where Mayor Richard Daley's machine was known for delivering whopping Democratic tallies by fair means and foul. When it became clear how narrowly Nixon lost, outraged Republicans grew convinced that cheating had tipped the election and lobbied for an investigation.Nixon always insisted that others, including President Eisenhower, encouraged him to dispute the outcome but that he refused. A challenge, he told others, would cause a "constitutional crisis," hurt America in the eyes of the world, and "tear the country apart." Besides, he added, pursuing the claims would mean "charges of 'sore loser' would follow me through history and remove any possibility of a further political career."

Contrast 1960 to 2000. In the 2000 election, Al Gore pulled every dirty trick in the book to try to steal the election, including manufacturing the bogus "the ballot was confusing" claim. Afterwards, the media paid to have Gore's recounts continue....only to learn that Bush STILL won - and won with an even greater margin. A reporter embedded with the Gore Campaign, Bill Samman, wrote a book detailing the tricks pulled by the Gore campaign in their attempt to steal the election. The book is entitled At Any Cost: How Al Gore Tried to Steal the Election. It's available in paperback at Amazon.com.

Keep in mind that this is just one person at one polling place. Consider that this is being done by thousands of people at thousands of polling places....and a better perspective of the problem develops.[Video] Reporter James O’Keefe Allowed to Vote as 20 Different People Without Showing Any IDBy Reagan Wilson on November 3, 2014Investigative Reporter James O’Keefe has completely destroyed the idea that voting with no ID requirements does not result in election fraud.In his latest undercover video, O’Keefe shows how easy it is for him to go vote as 20 different people just by providing a name and address, without an identification whatsoever. Please note, O’Keefe did not actually complete the voting process in any of the instances, so no laws were broken.Only 1 poll worker is suspicious of O’Keefe and refuses to let him vote.North Carolina is one of only 19 states that allows voting without any sort of proof of identification at all. A recently passed law will take effect in 2016 which will require NC voters to have valid ID before they can vote.According to the video description on Youtube:“Of all of the undercover investigations I’ve conducted, this was by far the easiest. They were willing to pass out fraudulently obtained ballots like it was Halloween candy,” said James O’Keefe.“With almost three-quarters-of-a-million inactive voters and no Voter ID law in place, we could have turned the election results for most major candidates in the state. What we uncovered in this video illustrates how easy it would be for a well-orchestrated campaign with no regard for the law to change the outcome of a major election.Voter laws across the country need to be changed immediately to prevent this sort of potential voter fraud.”

Just in Phoenix, Arizona, alone, several notorious Reconquista (pro-illegal alien) and left wing extremist groups, Promise Arizona, Citizens for a Better Arizona, and Mi Familia Vota, last week hand delivered thousands of absentee ballots to the state elections department. These groups are known to be major players in Arizona election fraud. It's believed that U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva was only elected by illegal aliens registered to vote by Mi Familia Vota.The way these groups - and such groups in other states - operate is this:1. They get canvassers appointed as voter registrars (a simple process anyone can do).2. They then canvass areas known to have heavy numbers of illegal aliens.3. They convince the illegal aliens that signing the voter registration form will help them obtain amnesty.4. They then submit to the elections department a request for the illegal aliens to vote by absentee ballot (they do this because they don't trust the illegals to show up at the polls, and because most illegals do not read English OR Spanish).5. When the state mails out the absentee ballots, the "activists" show up to "help" the illegals fill them out.6. They then seal the ballots, gather them up, mail or hand deliver them to the elections department.This has been going on for decades. It has been estimated that several hundred thousand illegal alien votes were cast in the 2012 election alone....many of them in "swing" states.

Voter Fraud and Voter I.D.By Thomas Sowell November 4, 2014One of the biggest voter frauds may be the idea promoted by Attorney General Eric Holder and others that there is no voter fraud, that laws requiring voters to have a photo identification are just attempts to suppress black voting.Reporter John Fund has written three books on voter fraud and a recent survey by Old Dominion University indicates that there are more than a million registered voters who are not citizens (illegal aliens), and who therefore are not legally entitled to vote.The most devastating account of voter fraud may be in the book "Injustice" by J. Christian Adams. He was a Justice Department attorney, who detailed with inside knowledge the voter frauds known to the Justice Department, and ignored by Attorney General Holder and Company.One of these frauds involved sending out absentee ballots to people who had never asked for them. Then a political operator would show up -- uninvited -- the day the ballots arrived and "help" the voter to fill them out. Sometimes the intruders simply took the ballots, filled them out and forged the signatures of the voters.These were illegal votes for Democrats, which may well be why Eric Holder sees no evil, hears no evil and speaks no evil.As for race-based "voter suppression," amid all the political hysteria, how many hard facts have you heard? Probably none that supports that claim. Widely available free photo identification cards mean that poverty is no barrier to voting.Since blacks and whites both have to show photo I.D. for everything from cashing checks to getting on a plane, why has requiring a photo I.D. for voting caused such shrill outcries?Unfortunately, this is part of the cynical politics of promoting as much racial polarization and paranoia as possible, in hopes of getting more black voters to turn out to vote for the Democrats.Nothing is too gross when promoting racial hysteria in an election year. Veteran Democrat Congressman Charlie Rangel from Harlem declared that Republicans "don't disagree -- they hate!" According to Rangel, "Some of them believe that slavery isn't over and that they won the Civil War!"Republicans did win the Civil War. That's why there is no more slavery. It was a Republican president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation. It was a Republican-controlled Congress that voted for the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery.In the 1960s, a higher percentage of Republicans than Democrats voted for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. If we are going to talk about history, let's at least get the facts right.Only an utter ignorance of history, in this era of dumbed-down education, could allow demagogues like Rangel to get away with the absurdities that abound in election year politics.Images of lynching and Jim Crow laws that made blacks sit in the back of buses are used against Republicans, even though the "solid South" was solidly controlled by Democrats during that era.Bull Connor, who turned police dogs and fire hoses on civil rights demonstrators, was a Democrat. So were other Southern segregationists. In those days, you could go hundreds of miles through the Jim Crow South without seeing a single Republican official. That is why political observers called it "the solid South."Perhaps the biggest voter fraud of all is the fraud against black voters, by telling them bogey man stories, in order to try to get them to come out on election day to vote for Democrats.The most cynical of these bogey man ploys is Attorney General Holder's threats of legal action against schools that discipline a "disproportionate" number of black boys. Unless you believe that black boys cannot possibly be misbehaving more often than Asian American girls, what does this political numbers game accomplish?It creates another racial grievance, allowing Democrats like Holder to pose as rescuers of blacks from racist dangers. The real danger is allowing disruptive students in ghetto schools to destroy the education of other black students -- in a world where education is the only hope that most ghetto youngsters have for a better life.Sacrificing these young people's futures, in hopes of gaining some additional black votes today, is as cynical and fraudulent as it gets.

 Democrats claim that American blacks are too stupid to obtain a photo ID. Apparently, South African blacks are smarter:

The latest "cause" for the Democrats is drivers licenses for illegal aliens.  Hmmmm. you don't suppose that has anything to do with thwarting voter ID laws, do you?

Site says Obama stole election through voter fraud November 24, 2012 barackofraudo.comDuring the election, The Examiner's Dean Chambers caused quite a stir when he talked about polls being skewed for Obama, something many conservatives reported. Now that the election is over, Chambers is focused on what he said is the reason for Obama's victory. On Saturday, The Blaze reported that Chambers' new site, barackofraudo.com, shows that Obama received 80 electoral votes in four states due largely to voter fraud."Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk," the site says, quoting Henry David Thoreau."Evidence of vote fraud is very much like that," Chambers wrote on the site."Those who engage in it are slick and do all they can to hide it, so the evidence is often quite circumstantial. In fact, often the circumstantial evidence is all the evidence we have, such was finding tens of thousands of bogus votes in the ballot box, we didn't see someone actually put them there, but they are found, they are there, and they are clearly evidence of vote fraud," he added. "Such is true of the voting divisions where Obama gets 100 percent of the votes cast. As if anyone REALLY believes that is legitimate."The Blaze reported that Chambers was mocked throughout the election for his site, UnSkewedPolls.com, where he attempted to, as Dave Weigel wrote at Slate, put "into numbers what other conservatives put into words."But according to Chambers, four states -- Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida -- should rightfully have gone to Romney, and would have were it not for voter fraud."I'm getting credible information of evidence in those states that there enough numbers that are questionable and could have swung the election," he said, according to Weigel. "I'm only putting good credible information on there, like the actual vote counts, reports, and mainstream publications reporting voter fraud," he added.Chambers admits, however, that right now there is a lot of noise with very little substance."There's a lot of chatter, though. There are articles people have sent me that don't hold up. Crazy stuff," he said."What's not crazy?" Weigel asked."Things like the 59 voting divisions of Philadelphia where Romney received zero votes," Chambers said. "Even Larry Sabato said that should be looked into."Weigel said that "57 precincts gave McCain no votes in 2008.""There's such a thing as a 99% Democratic precinct, and such a thing as a 99% Republican precinct," he added.Chambers said that Ohio had irregularities that didn't get much media attention."Some of the precincts or divisions in Cleveland were projected to be 99% Obama. That's a part of the state where it's known that a lot of ballot box scamming has been done in the past," he said. "There were isolated reports of people voting for Romney and having votes changed, though they didn't get much attention."Chambers also noted that Romney went from an 80,000 lead in Virginia to losing by 120,000."When votes were being counted on election night, 97% of the precincts were counted, and Romney was still leading 50-49," he said. "When that remaining 3% were counted, a lead of 80,000 or so votes for Romney were turned into 120,000 for Obama.""Because of missed details like this, and his erroneous claim elsewhere that Virginia wasn’t called until Obama was leading, Chambers’ argument probably won’t face any success, or be taken with much seriousness by RNC leaders," Holt added.Even if there was overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence of voter fraud, Bob Unruh wrote at WND that the GOP would be powerless to stop it, thanks to a 1982 court case between the two parties.According to Unruh, "a race-based consent decree negotiated by Democrats against the Republican National Committee a generation ago still has tied the RNC’s hands, and GOP officials could be cited for contempt – or worse – if they try to make sure American elections are clean."

Notice that the media conveniently failed to note that these women are all Democrats.  Eight voters came forward in this case to say that Hart or her associates marked their ballots for them with the name of a candidate that they did not want to vote for.  How many others did not come forward?Who is naive enough to believe that this was the first time these women practiced this common form of vote fraud?  Who doesn't think that they did the same thing in 2012? This case in a small town in Alabama is but a microcosm of similar acts occurring by the thousands all over the U.S. by Democrats.   Guilty plea entered in vote fraud case   Posted on Jan 13, 2015by  Matt Elofson Crime and courts reporter  Janice Lee HartA Dothan woman facing eight felony absentee ballot fraud charges pleaded guilty Tuesday afternoon to reduced misdemeanor charges.Circuit Court Judge Brad Mendheim sentenced Hart to 12 months in the Houston County Jail for each charge, which he suspended in favor of two years probation for each charge.Mendheim ordered Hart to pay a $200 fine, a $25 victim’s compensation fee and court costs for each of the eight misdemeanor convictions.“You may not have any invovlment with any absentee ballot voting or any other voting other than your own voting,” Mendheim said. “You shouldn’t be involved in any of the behavior alleged in these cases.”Mendheim ordered Hart to pay $40 per month toward her fines and court costs starting in March.Hart was the first of a group of four people indicted by a Houston County grand jury last year to go to trial in connection to an absentee ballot fraud investigation.Hart was one of three women who worked on the 2013 campaign for District 2 City Commissioner Amos Newsome.In the election, Newsome beat challenger Lamesa Danzey by 14 votes. Newsome received 119 of the 124 absentee votes that were cast. Danzey received more votes than Newsome at the polls.Attorney Ben Freeman, who represented Hart, said the defense was satisfied with resolution of the cases, especially in that his client avoided any felony convictions.Freeman said the case, which ended after several witnesses for the prosecution had already testified, came down to the legal definition of a witness.“The law doesn’t define it very well,” Freeman said. “As far as voter affidavits, the law is just not real clear as to what you’re representing when you sign it as a witness.”District Attorney Doug Valeska said the voter fraud law in Alabama needs to be clarified, specifically the definition of a legal witness.“The Legislature needs to address, clear up and define what a witness is,” Valeska said. “It needs to be spelled out that the two people who are witnesses actually have to sign it and watch it.”Valeska told the jury during his opening statements Tuesday morning in order for an absentee ballot to be counted it must be signed by two witnesses or a notary. Valeska said the prosecution planned to show Hart wasn’t present when with the voters even though she was listed as witness on the absentee ballot.Freeman argued during his opening statements that the evidence will show his client and Olivia Lee Reynolds only signed their names as witnesses. He argued his client did not need to be with the voter to be listed as a witness.“Every one of them, she knew them,” Freeman said. “They assisted people in these campaigns and in absentee voting.”Freeman said his client was there every single time as a witness, but she stayed outside in a van.“My client has a medical issue,” Freeman said “She can’t walk very well, and uses a cane. She can’t get in and out of the house very easily.”Valeska said no plea deals have been made with any of the three other people charged in the voter fraud investigation.Multiple charges remain pending against 65-year-old Reynolds, 49-year-old Lesa Renee Coleman and 37-year-old Daniel Webster Reynolds III.COMMENTS: Sidney Pridgen · Top Commenter · Cairo, GeorgiaVoter fraud should be punishable by life in prison.  JJames Lovic Mclean · Top Commenter · Dothan High SchoolStealing one vote should be a felony. Stop letting dumb people off with just a slap on the wrist. Plain ole common sense tells what a witness is Bill Clinton. Stealing a vote means stealing from every citizen of this country. David Coker · Top CommenterThis is how odumbo got elected in the first place........ She and others like her should loose their voting rights and do JAIL time!!!!!
