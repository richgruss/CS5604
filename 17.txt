ARE YOU ADDICTED TO YOUR CELL PHONE? READ THIS..

PC Tips

Cellphone addiction is in the same family as other technology addictions, such as computers and gaming, which are all part of a larger family of behavioral addictions (to gambling, exercise, sex, etc.). Anything that can produce pleasure in your brain has the potential of becoming addictive. Loss of control is the essential element of any addiction.



Research has identified the “six signs” of any type of substance or behavioral addiction. Those six signs – salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse – apply to cellphone addiction as well.

Are you addicted?

Let’s see.

Read the definitions of each of the six signs below and then agree or disagree with the following statements. By the time you’ve completed this task, you will have a better idea of whether you’ve reached your tipping point when it comes to your cellphone use.

*

Salience

A behavior becomes salient when it is deeply integrated into your daily routine.

1. The first thing I reach for after waking in the morning is my cellphone.

2. I would turn around and go back home on the way to work if I had left my cellphone at home.

Euphoria

Who knows what the beep, buzz, whistle, or stylized ringtone might have in store for you? The feeling of anticipation or excitement that precedes and/or follows the use of your cellphone is a mood modification that can result in euphoria.

3. I often use my cellphone when I am bored.

4. I have pretended to take calls to avoid awkward social situations.

Tolerance

As in the case of drug and alcohol abuse, tolerance addresses the need for an ever-increasing “dose” of the behavior to achieve the desired “high.”

5. I find myself spending more and more time on my cellphone.

6. I spend more time than I should on my cellphone.

Withdrawal symptoms

The feelings of irritability, stress, anxiousness, desperation, and even panic that often occur when you are separated from your cellphone are good examples of withdrawal symptoms.

7. I become agitated or irritable when my cellphone is out of sight.

8. I have gone into a panic when I thought I had lost my cellphone.

Conflict

A common outcome of cellphone addiction is conflict. Do your spouse or children complain that you are always on your phone? Do you allow texts, calls, and e-mails to spoil your vacations and personal time? Are your work activities interrupted by playing games, visiting Facebook, and countless other forms of entertainment offered on your cellphone?

9. I have argued with my spouse, friends, or family about my cellphone use.

10. I use my cellphone while driving my car.

Relapse

When we acknowledge that our cellphone use may be undermining our well-being, we attempt to stop. But then we slip back. We relapse.

11. I have tried to curb my cellphone use, but the effort didn’t last very long.

12. I need to reduce my cellphone use, but am afraid I can’t do it.

How to Use Your Android Device as a Mouse, Keyboard,and more







      
       Using your Android to control your computer is a great way to interact with programs. Your phone can be used a trackpad, or could be used to use a media player using custom controls.Monect lets you take things further by turning your Android device into all manner of peripherals.

What Are the Options?

There are plenty of apps available in Google Player that let you use your phone or tablet as a wireless keyboard or mouse for a computer. Monect can be used in this way, but it also boasts a number of other options that cater to a variety of scenarios.



This free app can transform your phone into not only a mouse or keyboard, but also a joystick, gamepad, media controller and much more. It’s great for gamers, but options such as text transfer and presentation mode open up additional opportunities.

DOWNLOAD THE ANDROID APP HERE

DOWNLOAD THE PC APP HERE



You’ll need to extract the contents of the zip file and then launch the file named MonectHost. You’ll probably find that your firewall kicks in and you’ll need to allow the program to make use of your network in order to continue.



Getting Connected

Assuming your phone and computer are connected to the same wireless network, it will take a matter of seconds to establish a connection.

On your phone or tablet, install a copy of Monect from Google Play, launch the app and then either type in the IP address of your computer and tap Connect, or tap ‘Search host’ to scan for and connect to your machine.  If you find that you are unable to connect, trying restarting Windows to ensure that the installation is complete.



Once connected, you’ll see that are no less than 12 different modes to choose from; in most cases it is fairly obvious what each one does, and each can be used in different ways.



Controller Modes

Touchpad mode turns your phone into a laptop-style trackpad complete with a scroll bar to the right. In this mode you can also access 3D Mouse mode which enables you to move the cursor around by using your phone as a laser pointer.



Typewriter keys, Function keys and Numeric keypad are all modes in which you can use your phone as a keyboard. This can be handy if your keyboard is broken and you need a temporary replacement, or you are using a laptop or keyboard without a number pad.



In Text Transfer mode it is possible to type and prepare text on your phone and then send it to whatever application currently has focus on your computer.



Switch to My Computer mode and you can browse the contents of your hard drive from your Android device. Folders can be easily navigated, and files can be opened remotely, or downloaded to your phone – just tap and hold to bring up the option menu.



Things start to get particularly interesting for gamers in Race, Joystick and Shooter modes. The app takes advantage of your device’s built in gyroscope so that it can be used as a steering wheel, a more traditional joystick/gamepad or as a crosshair control for FPS games.



The remaining three modes, PowerPoint, Browser and Media mode are ideal for when your computer is connected to a larger screen, projector, or a TV. Each mode features the touchpad area and mouse buttons.

In each case there are task specific buttons at the top of the screen. So whether you are looking to control video playback from the comfort of your sofa, or you want to be able to browse the web on your TV without having to battle with a regular keyboard and mouse, Monect makes it easy.

thanks
